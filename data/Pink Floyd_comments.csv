the genius syd.
❤fantastic❤
Cool🖖
Roger and Syd the two only Genius of this band !!!
Pink Floyd the best 👍🤗🤗🤗🤗
Shine on you !...
Arnold Layne was trans before it was cool
"And the kids today think that pop videos stated with the MTV generation, little did they know.."
"Pink Floyd wrote ""Dogs"" 🐕"
SYD the genius rip 🙏 and Rick rip 🙏
Who thinks Syd tried cross-dressing at least once… 😜
It's just 100 percent awesome 👍
"Roger Keith ""syd"" Barrett thank you."
Heavy sound
"Dig it, who knew..."
"They are incredible, they made the band the best in the world, that's Pink Floyd 🎸🎶❤️🙋‍♂️✌️"
Pero el cambio que sufre PF sin Syd fue monumental..
"Seems like such a travesty that they have to interrupt it after such a brief showing. Pink Floyd at their finest with Syd leading the pack.
Back when all the boys liked each other. Young, fresh out of school I believe it was there first production video and what a hit it was.
RIP to Syd and Richard, The world will never be the same without the musical genius that was Pink Floyd 🌠🎶"
