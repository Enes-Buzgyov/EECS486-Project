"turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven"
