"Hello People of The World.

We are fighting the final war with satan and its fallen angels aka negative energy in the flesh  aka human body here on earth.

The Human Body is The Temple of God

Due to Sin, The Soul energy is positive and negative energy.
Energy CANNOT be destroyed, ONLY separated;
Therefore, choose this day which energy you will serve and be separated from and 4 eternity:

God = Life aka positive energy 

Satan = Death aka negative energy. 

The purpose of this life time is to defeat death aka negative energy aka satan to be allowed back in God's Heaven On Earth aka Paradise without Death aka Evil. 

The Key to open The Door / The Portal to enter God's Heaven On Earth aka Paradise is in The Bible. 

GOD is relationship, NOT religion.

Christians are the ONLY way to having a relationship with God and becoming a child of God. 

LIFE or DEATH 

Your Choice
And
Your free will

Jesus Christ is The Only Way, The Light, and The Truth.

ALL SINS CAN BE FORGIVEN
So don't be left behind in Darkness
And
Seek God's forgiveness today.

Sincerity,
A Friend."
"Hello Lil Uzi Vert and EVERYONE behind your music productions,

1st, 
Your name is NOT The Name Of A Child Of God.

And
2nd,

As Your God,
As Your Lord, 
As Your King,
And
As A Child Of God,
I CANNOT sing, play, NOR dance to your music
4
Your Music
 and
Your images do NOT Glorify The Image and likness of A Child Of God. 

I pray in Jesus name that EVERYONE who works behind  your music production and yourself come into repantance
4
Your souls do NOT glorifying God's Heaven On Earth Entertainment. 

Sincerity,
GOD's Warrior and Angel."

"La esencia es como tener la verdad y la mentira  dentro de tu ser... Dentro de tu poder.... 
Años de malas vibras la depresion me tenia de rehen ya no sabia ni que hacer, 
Bebe si tan solo me podrias comprender

Huyo de mis demonios  me quieren quieren ver acorralado
Bebe ayudame tengo 2 personalidad  dentro mio atasacado   una buena una mala.. bebe ayuda me prometiste que estaremos juntos en las buenas y en las malas, ahora mira....

"What happens in life is something we all face we know when we are born but don't know when we die. Believe that in the end of our lives the only thing that matters is if we repented and received the only thing you get to keep forever and that is the eternal life God offers by receiving the Lord Jesus Christ. Everybody should give their life to Christ it as easy as receiving a birthday gift God offers us. If you haven't received Jesus Christ in your life do it now because after you die it's too late. 
Say this prayer out loud as if God can hear you because He can say:

LORD JESUS CHRIST I REPENT OF MY SINS FORGIVE ME FOR MY SINS.

COME INTO MY LIFE, HELP ME TO LIVE LIFE IN THE GOODNESS OF GOD. 
I MAKE YOU MY LORD AND SAVIOR. In Jesus Christ name Amen
The bible says if you confessed Jesus is Lord you shall be saved. You should find a bible believing church. Read the Bible yourself every day or listen to it being read on YouTube not to be saved but to build your faith The Lord Jesus Christ already paid for you to be saved on the cross God won't reject you He loves you, pray ask God everyday he hears and He cares for you and love's you in Jesus name."

Isso me lembra 2018
Beat is similar with  midnight city-flowerboy demi
shit brings peace to my soul🥶😢🥲🥲
nice amen break
uzi a goat for sampling this
"Lil Uzi is obviously a Naruto fan and this song reminds of plan that one of the villains had in Naruto. He had a plan to use a beast that could turn the moon red and make everyone on the world see and do whatever he pleases. The villain just wanted to manipulate their minds and make them be in state of happiness for the rest of their lives, which in other words is world domination but I understand why he wanted to do it in the end. I think this is why Lil Uzi stares at the red moon."
Where is this at
luv
Uzi is back  button>>>>>>
😂😂😂😂 uzi on the bus
I convinced my girlfriend with this music😂🌚
This is whack asf

this shit gotta be used for a jjk or csm amv please
Lil tony did it better
Blue moon
"I’m confused he said bleu in the song onetime?Just saying, Lil Uzi been getting more extreme with the vulnerability but it sounds like even though the pain Lil Uzi taking on now is tremendous bcuz of loneliness and lack of trust or empathy hes even still able to keep up the actual aesthetic beauty of his talent and actually use that pain to make simple masterpieces sometimes less is more … He was literally stripped to boxers? It seems like Lil uzi is trying to save Lil Uzi ..He crying by himself y’all…; around total strangers and the hate of being used like a puppet .. No, not just for HOLLYWEIRD but for survive for reasons he don’t realize.. I kan tell he feel the weight of the whole world on his shoulders just to get exposed right back to more success tied with more emotional and mental pressures is making him wonder why he still here but also realize that he must keep it together for the world that’s on his shoulders 😮… MIC DROP ***"
You listen to this a couple times it get stuck in your head omg 😭💯
Cant go wrong with some uzi
Lil Buzi😂😂

"Go get brittney bro , this that vibe . Jt not it"
"I really need to cry but I’ve become so numb that I can’t. I can feel the heaviness in my chest and my heart is physically aching. 😢 it’s so cold in my room so I’m just laying here miserable and alone in the cold. 

After months of having stopped using it, I just took an edible because I just can’t take this pain. I just wanna fade away and leave it all behind 😢. 
I wish I had someone to hold me and tell me it’ll be alright but I used to be a mute so I have no friends. 
There was a beautiful girl I had met 5 years ago and she was really into me but I was too mute to show her how much I wanted her. She had beautiful natural dark red hair and the most beautiful face and just thinking of her used to make me feel like the world was spinning around me. 

I have tears in my eyes right now. 
We only met once since she didn’t live near me but I truly loved her so so much. I can’t stop thinking about her when I get emotional like this. I can’t stop thinking what my life would be like had I not been a mute.  
I miss her so much 😢
Please someone hug me and tell me it’ll be alright
Please.
Im crying right now and I just can’t get over her. She was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen.
😭😭😭 I miss her so much"

We was playing this and my Brazilian butterscotch was rolling up another one, her cousin was in the city for the week visiting from her home town. My mans Larry Dune had her doing the toe touch, im talking all that 🎂 and not enough cuddles to fit type shit... Larry literally pop her knee out place for raw Dogg'n her so bad and she wasn't mad the funny thing is and I'll never forget ""Ive had dreams of this and always have a perc and zanny just in case"" but it was a foreign accent so it was twice as funny... Rip Larry man he was a good cat, 3 days later he died of high cholesterol... That was too much cake for any man, shit I woulda done the same... That's a good way to die, rip pouring up some dude for Larry"

"Hopeful this man finds Jesus. I think art is great maybe you can do some Christian Art for everyone UZi. Maybe reflect upon why you feel so inclined to push satanism in your music and art and then to the youth. I don’t think that’s you, maybe it’s the image your trying to paint for everyone. Truly your not a bad person I don’t think but I’m not god so my judgment doesn’t matter but you are a sinner at the end of the day."

"IF you are reading this, I just want you to know that the pain DOES go away,  be grateful for your place on this earth, I know it can seem dull sometimes if not most times, but you just have to be yourself, if people don't accept you for you then that's on them, never let your happiness or peace be determined by others, because when the lights go off and the show is over, its you AND ONLY YOU, so if anything , learn to love yourself. Be brave, be courageous, take the risks, but keep your calm , keep your cool, and i promise it will be okay."

"1 Corinthians 15:1-4 NLT — Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place. I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said."
"I wanna put more on earth
But i can't
What i can't
Is a choice to not with take
Felt how fake yea love was no intake 
Sometimes we don't make mistakes
Or do because we miss what's stake
Humans now days pale"

I watched the moon tonight and it was red (It was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (To not complain)

But our love is not the same (Woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'

You go right now, then I ain't—

[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (Woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (You)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' (Please)
Starin' (Please), woah
The red, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), oh, oh

But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'

Through thick and thin, come sun or rain,
A cherished connection that will remain."

This is amazing .
"I love uzi, like he’s different, he can give us a new style, then resort back too his original style, then sell us a mix of both on another track, like this one, he’s so diverse in this music industry ❤️"
I do watch the moon thinking about us
this shit actually so tough
Gay ?
"This is peak modern Lo-fi. This is the stuff that needs to get into the charts. We need this sound to make a mark in the music industry, Lo-fi may be simple, but music should be simple. Back to it's roots, the feeling and emotion. Sure Uzi's vocals here are very uhh, 'tuned' but thats the point, and thats the point of his music, and thats the point of Lo'fi... we need this."
What sample did he use
don't cry uzi❤
Samples Cafune - tek it
gives lil b vibes .. tybg
"Yooo bro puting

"Love is a perpetual energy, it never ends but true love acknowledges the end. That’s the red moon. Uzi keepin it apocalyptic!! Love it."
"Didn't like the song initially when I heard it on Spotify, but together with the clip it is a masterpiece"
It's so strange to see the city you live in a music video! beautifully shot

Where was this filmed? It looks like New Zealand
I love me some uziiii 😊❤
kai cenat
Anime vibes with the beat🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I love low budget music videos like this, there's something so personal and authentic about it. Sometimes a well directed music video with props and payed actors and shit can actually take away from a music video, and this is one of those instances. Uzi made the right call with this song to just keep it simple and low key, it's actually very refreshing to see once in awhile."
Good music with lyrics.❤🎉
when will luv is rage 3 come out?
"If you're wondering, the sample in the background is Tek It- Cafune"
🖤🖤🖤🖤
1 thing Fasho never let a female make you feel like that and 2nd don't ever crash out it plenty 🐟 in the sea fellas I been through that but ain't no female worth it.

tm88 really the goat
DOPE
bro must miss JT. he put his foot in this one
One of my favorite artists on a sample of one of my favorite songs. It doesn't get any better than this 🔥
Único problema dessa música é que ela acaba
"Cara vc é sensacional, que musica perfeita essa é a melhor musica que eu ouvi esse ano!!!!!!!!!!"
How much melanin do I need in my blood to understand ghetto black culture?
Does anyone know any other songs with this sample? There’s a fire one I used to know but can’t remember what it’s called.
On TIER
Never fails 🔥
Did uzi just make a trippie redd song
I literally need an album of this. Masterpiece
Shit yeah my home town 🎉
Beautiful
"I don’t wanna hear any uzi Carti comparisons. Carti is pure entertainment and other then playing his song live, or when your going out is unbearable if your 25 plus 😂😂 uzi can actually make soothing listenable tracks."
Bro was forcing them tears like getting water out of a rag
""
"dam, he lost JT 😭"
"crazy how he didn't even mention ""cafune"" the creator of the song ten ""I watch the moon"" #watchthemoon"

Uzi🌈🔥🩸🩸🙏🏻💯🚫🧢
I felt lowkey
New warzone edit song🔥
WHAT SAMPLE IS THIS
🇧🇷
Cafune sample is hard.
The last thing I was expecting from the Vert was a Cafune sample.
"Follow Jesus, He will forgive you and set you free from the demons"
Love the right side up cross

TheReal Uzi is Back!!!!
V 2:03
Imagine walking down the street and seeing Uzi recording for a music video 🔥🖤
✅✅✅✅
Broski never disappoint!
ITS FINALLY ON STREAMING SERVICES‼️‼️
We need more music like this
"People gonna call this “trash” because they’re hooked on a certain beat or style of songs, but give credit where it’s due name a rapper besides who carti I guess, that can switch up everything from what they originally debut with and still have people liking it."
Love the sample
It’s not half bad
"The Drum n Bass sample, Uzi is totally a 90s kid"
"Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! 
     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”
      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. 
     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. 
     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! 
     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” 
     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. 

     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”

"Hey I know what you could do to reach another level with new music. Harmonies. Your melodies are beautiful, but if you.. you know, hit another note that matches your leads with the vocals, that would be angelic. It's not just hitting the octaves but different notes. It sounds really wholesome and uwu and beautiful ❤️"

"This sounds absolutely divine. I caught a snippet on Instagram Live and fell in love with it instantly. This song couldn't have come out at a more perfect time in my life. I recently lost the girl of my dreams, and it's been incredibly tough. However, heading into a new year, I'm feeling genuinely confident. I know I can elevate myself, become better, and achieve more success than ever before. My hope and wish for everyone reading this is to find success as we enter the new year."
"Lil Uzi my brother, look around, look at the people who surround you, focus on what you already have and not on what you lost, think about yourself and your loved ones, many of us have survived this shit and we are your fans will always support and love you , your tears hurt us and make us cry with you, we love you and believe that you will get out of this! be the best version of yourself my brother. 🖤🦇😇"

Shot uzi for filming in Auckland New Zealand 🇳🇿
"This sounds absolutely divine. I caught a snippet on Instagram Live and fell in love with it instantly. This song couldn't have come out at a more perfect time in my life. I recently lost the girl of my dreams, and it's been incredibly tough. However, heading into a new year, I'm feeling genuinely confident. I know I can elevate myself, become better, and achieve more success than ever before. My hope and wish for everyone reading this is to find success as we enter the new year."

So Uzi wants to do DnB now?
"deep beautiful song. with so many messges.. the visuals, you can see the energy & message how he’s feeling. what he goes through in a daily base.. we have absolutely no idea the real stress he faces. so much work into his projects, videos, roll outs & experiencing his sound & aesthetics. Uzi wants a normal life . never seen an artist so open with their feelings, emotions, positive vibes & ALWYS  being himself . huge inspiration in my life. i get the messsge.. i really hope Uzi is okay and finds his peace. & surrounds himself around good people. MUCH LOVE UZI++"
As a long fan uzi no just no man stick to the old rap ways i promise the love was much more great full
I liked my own coomet

"Brother was really in his whitey tighties. For real though, the next album is going to shake the hip-hop/rap world in a way we've never seen before.

Uzi, you've changed rap as a whole, your lyricism, flow, singing, rapping, beats, creativity and music videos. 

I pray you continue to live your life how you want even after you're done with music. THANK YOU UZI!



I heard the snippet on instagram live and loved it since the first listen"
I feel you lil uzi. I miss GFRIEND too.
Best Uzi song in a minute tbh
"Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
I watch the moon all the time thinkin' about you
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah

[Verse 1]
I watched the moon tonight and it was red
I wanna live together till we dead
I tell myself that I can change
Remind myself to not complain

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times""

[Post-Chorus]
Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—

[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin'
Starin', woah
The red, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times"""
"Lil lucifer knows the meaning of a red moon..Before the dawn of science, a red Moon was seen as a bad omen. In the Christian bible, it's referred to as, among other things, a harbinger of the apocalypse."

"@LILUZIVERT I can tell are TIRED, just of life in this fucked up place in general. Hopefully the planet you bought awhile back you can eventually fly to it and live in peace because this world right here is turning you into pieces that you got to keep bringing back together. I get my guy. If we give up on not giving up then we give out, but if we give in then what have we really been giving. Anyways, I stare at that same moon brotha just know somebody out there sees your vision. Keep your head up ❤"

Thank you Mr Woods. U helped me a lot throughout the years.
as much as i love Uzi this song ain't it. using a cheap sped up song as a beat is lame and i know hes capable of more
living without being hype for new uzi nor seeing his face on my feed would be weird. carried me through high school and uni.

Uzi wants a normal life . never seen an artist so open with their feelings, emotions, positive vibes & ALWYS  being himself . huge inspiration in my life. i get the messsge.. i really hope Uzi is okay and finds his peace. & surrounds himself around good people. MUCH LOVE UZI💕++"

I recently lost the girl of my dreams, and it's been incredibly tough. However, heading into a new year, I'm feeling genuinely confident. I know I can elevate myself, become better, and achieve more success than ever before. My hope and wish for everyone reading this is to find success as we enter the new year."

Sure we all had the same point."

Uzi Vert is the new legend moon power
FILMED IN NEW ZEALAND!
I’ve missed this Uzi
🔥🔥🔥
"💯💯🔥 peace, mine and soul, my brother, let the spirits take you to the space and beyond"
"Brother was really in his whitey tighties. For real though, the next album is going to shake the hip-hop/rap world in a way we've never seen before.
Uzi, you've changed rap as a whole, your lyricism, flow, singing, rapping, beats, creativity and music videos. 
I pray you continue to live your life how you want even after you're done with music. THANK YOU UZI!

I heard the snippet on instagram live and loved it since the first listen"
this video got hella aura
"Such a cool vibe switch from Uzi here, specifically with visuals. Could've done without him taking off his undies tho"
Keep inspiring us Uzi 🔥
What a Christmas 😭
I almost gave up on Uzi….he got me back in this one….
When he’s on the beach running it’s like a anime scene
rip uzi
"How people listen to this, and then say he fell off is beyond me. Bro is in his element on this song."

"This is really good, LIR3 soon"

Our monthly drop is finally here❤
Uziiii🖤
Lowkey reminds me of the music i make💪🏾😤🔥🙏🏽
"Good video bud. You can make love real with a person who loves you just for you as you are. I was definitely in your frame of mind a few years ago but now I have hope. Shit happens to us all but try to keep your head up and know that times love can go back and forth. There’s a few women that I truly was in love with but because of circumstances it didn’t work. I was definitely in your same spot of crying. Stuff happens bud, yet it can work out! I’ll be flying to England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 in 2025 and if everything goes right I’ll be chilling with my future wife over there for a while."

🔥
Luv is rage 3 will be amazing
"This song is addictive, I can’t stop listening to it bruh"
"JESUS CHRIST is the greatest of all time, not this puppet of the devil. I hope Uzi turns to God and changes his ways but I unfortunately don't think it's likely. But there's still time. Repent and find Jesus Christ Yeshua Hamashiach the savior of humanity the one who paid the debt of you and I's sins, the holy one of israel, the way the truth and the life, the prince of peace, the alpha and omega, the beginning and end the first and the last, the messiah, the sinless one, He is LOVE himself, and he loves you more than you could ever understand because he crafted you from nothing and wants us all to have our place with him in his heavenly kingdom, but he loves us so much he gave us the choice to follow him there or not. Make the right choice and follow him instead of yourself, follow the one who made you and understands your wants and needs better than you do, not the devil who wants to kill steal and destroy. In Yeshua's name, Amen."

"I don’t know why I listen to this genre of music, hoping that it will actually musically sound good. But they’re all garbage and have no appreciation for musicians. It’s just garbage. No musical ability anywhere"
It’s never too late to turn to god lil uzi ❤🙏
Be el be goat !

I took a shit to this song
"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined african tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical african war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 african tribes/10 african tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."
This reminds me of Stewies Bryan Adams music video 😂

IM BY MYSELF AND IM STARING AT THE RED MOON 🌕♥️🦇⚡️⭐️💞🔥🥇
"[Intro]
I watch the moon all the time thinkin' about you
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah

[Verse 1]
I watched the moon tonight and it was red (It was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (To not complain)

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same (Woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs (Shut)
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times""

[Post-Chorus]
Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—

[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (Woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (You)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' (Please)
Starin' (Please), woah
The red, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), oh, oh

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times"""

"terrible  beat  progression,  old, stay old."

"Sonically this sounds like eveything else. Though, the lyrics definitely hit, but I honeslty think think this track is mediocre. Uzi is overhypped mass produced pop music for a generation mid people. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

And If you mad at this, its just cuz you mid too!"
I'm from Gabon and i like this😢🇬🇦
Replayed it back for a hour straight

"[Intro]
I watch the moon all the time thinkin' about you
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah

[Verse 1]
I watched the moon tonight and it was red (It was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (To not complain)

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same (Woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs (Shut)
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times""

[Post-Chorus]
Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—

[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (Woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (You)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' (Please)
Starin' (Please), woah
The red, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), oh, oh

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the times"""

She said time and time again she was going to change but in these 2 years i barely saw any. She's still cold with me, she wont show me affection, it looks like she doesn't care at all.

this is what Griffith heard during the Eclipse
"turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven"
WHY THE DO HIM LIKE THAT..KEEP IT GANGSTA UZI

"Video Concept like a bengali song..
But damn!🎉💣"
The message at the end is exactly what I needed
"Matthew 7:13-14 NLT — “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it."
uzi made a mistake now its gods time🙏
"John 14:6-7 NLT — Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me. If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is. From now on, you do know him and have seen him!”"
"Luke 23:34 NLT — Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice."

Remind myself to not complain (Not complain)

But our love is not the same (Woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin’
You go right now, then I ain’t breathin’
She’s on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can’t even read the signs (Shut)
She said, “Stop cryin’, and get used to the tryin'”

Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin’
You go right now, then I ain’t—


Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin’ back thinkin’, got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin’ ’bout my relationships that didn’t even last (Woah)
What I didn’t get out of them, I swear that I’m tryna get it up out you (You)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I’m by myself and I’m just starin’ at a red moon
I’m by myself and I’m just starin’ (Please)
Starin’ (Please), woah
The red, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), oh, oh

"This is a beautiful song that is amplified greatly by the visuals
A very profound and heartfelt message by Lil Uzi Vert
I’m grateful to have witnessed his development over the years as a musician and artist
I try not to take for granted these moments because I know one day there will be no more Uzi, no more music, and good times long gone
Don’t ever lose yourself
You come into this world alone and you gonna leave it that way"
"sorry uzi🌚😞

"“If someone can be away from you, let them be.
It’s better to be alone than losing yourself for approval.”

Needed to hear this 🙏"
he sampled Tek It (another great song)
shit he is using the same hoodie in this video that he was using on the day that his girl threw his phone at him.. he know what hes doing
Ayo is DNB gonna be a new type of trap beat here?! I love the EDM / Rap crossover.
If somebody can be away from you let them I needed to read that
Thanks Lil Uzi your final message reached me in the Right moment
the fuck is this bro
Uzi helps me escape from my own mind that I sometimes get trapped in. Reminds me that love heartbreak isn’t something that is worth damaging your soul over for. Better to just defrag and erase it from your memory and to be the best version of yourself as you can be. Wait patiently for the right person to accept you for who you are and your flaws and imperfections. LIG3
I hear Future behind this track and the inspiration is how Carti keeps breaking your heart. I knew you would be upset that you weren’t included. Peep the hair and how this video was previously shot. “Future - Never End”
Uziiiii
This is the best christmas gift  Uzi gave to us it reminds me of 20mins like it was dropped also at christmas
who told bro to drop this ???
This recorded in Australia?
Hard 🔥

"""Love isn't real, but with my imagination, I can make anything real.""
                                                                                                   - Lil Uzi Vert"
"thank u for making this, uzi"
[CAFUNE - TEK IT] WAS SUCH A HARD SAMPLE CHOICE
this the uzi we needed
"a good time to drop, been going through it lately, shit hits hard"
beautiful ash I love you Uzi ❤️💕💕💕 merry Christmas
Why this isn't in Spotify 🔥🔥🔥
He’s deadass a real rockstar
"Been listening to speedcore for like a decade and Uzi really used elements of it........ this'll make ""normal"" niggas fw it"
Him sampling “Tek it” makes me orgasm. Goated artist plus gasss song = YESSIRRR
I must be blind I can't even read the signs 🤞🏿
Uzi Emo 2007
"this song couldn't have dropped at a better time in my life. Lost the girl of my dreams a short while ago, it's been real hard, but going into a new year im feeling real confident and know i can up myself, and become better and more successful then i've ever been in the past.

Shout out to Auckland 🔥
"Lil Uzi Vert. You used to be one of my favorite artists before I got saved by Jesus Christ. I'm here to tell you that I understand the pain you may have encountered through broken relationships. I have been through terrible breakups, but brother Jesus Christ is real. His love is so sufficient & like no other. He is Love. He is the epitome of Love. You should truly seek him, brother. He filled me with his Love & I haven't felt hurt since. This is a genuine comment because I still love you & I hate to see you go through common things we all go through with no true help. The music wont save you, neither the cars, neither the diamonds, nor the fans, nor the people around you its all vanity. Only you truly knows what it feels like to be you when your'e alone. I Love you brother. Jesus is the way!"
fake
I LOVE THIS SM

This song is on repeat for me 😌 our love is not the same .
"[Intro]
I watch the moon all the time thinkin' about you
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah

[Verse 1]
I watched the moon tonight and it was red (It was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (To not complain)


[Chorus]
But our love is not the same (Woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs (Shut)
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the tryin'""

[Post-Chorus]
Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—

[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (Woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (You)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' (Please)
Starin' (Please), woah
The red, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), oh, oh

[Chorus]
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't—
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, ""Stop cryin', and get used to the tryin'"""

I watched the moon tonight and it was red (It was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (To not complain)

Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't
[Verse 2]
Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (Yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (Woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (You)

GOATTTTTTT
🩸❤️
Please don't retire the game need you...
Bros trying to be Carti but I still love you
Dope song. Lil Uzi never fails to make fire music. But yeah... I don't know if it's just me but I feel like Lil Uzi is now toning it down and becoming a regular human nowadays and finding out who he really is after being in the rap game for 10+ years. Yes he'll have his hype moments here and there but after a rollercoaster throughout his life (when he first joined in the rap game) he's evolving. And if you don't change you'll never become a better person.
Mink flow
Love you forever uzi ❤️
Uzii ❤‍🩹🥀
Uzi 💜
Best Christmas present ever!
We love you Uzi ❤

To the blind, he is the light.

For the poor, he is treasure.
For me, he is everything.
If Uzi thinks, I agree. 💯"

Comment
"Lil Uzi Vert's ""Red Moon"" isn't just another track. It's a transcendent experience that pierced through the mundane fabric of my existence and reshaped the very essence of who I am.

The first time I heard the haunting melody of ""Red Moon,"" something shifted within me. The hypnotic beats paired with Uzi's celestial vocals seemed to whisper secrets of destiny and ambition. At that moment, I was just another dreamer, struggling to find my footing in a world that often felt indifferent.

""Red Moon"" became more than a song; it was my anthem, my guide, my cosmic compass. Its lyrics spoke of defiance, resilience, and a refusal to accept mediocrity. As I listened on repeat, the words etched themselves into the fiber of my being, urging me to break free from the shackles of my circumstances.

I was broke, living paycheck to paycheck, with dreams that seemed galaxies away. But ""Red Moon"" ignited a fire within me, propelling me into action. The song wasn't just about the beat; it was about the mindset it cultivated—an unwavering belief in my own potential, a determination to carve my path regardless of the odds stacked against me.

Empowered by the spirit of ""Red Moon,"" I channeled every ounce of my energy into my passion. I worked tirelessly, relentlessly chasing my dreams with an unwavering resolve. I seized opportunities, embraced failures as stepping stones, and refused to settle for anything less than my vision of success.

And slowly, but surely, the tides began to turn. Doors that were once firmly shut began creaking open. Opportunities flowed in like a cosmic symphony echoing the rhythm of ""Red Moon."" I transformed my passion into a thriving career, my dedication into financial stability.

Now, here I stand, no longer the person I was when that song first graced my ears. I've tasted the sweetness of success, scaled the heights of achievement, and amassed the wealth that once seemed like a distant mirage. ""Red Moon"" wasn't just a song in my playlist; it was the catalyst that propelled me from rags to riches, from uncertainty to unwavering abundance.

So, whenever I hear those ethereal notes, I'm reminded not just of a song but of the transformative power of belief, perseverance, and the uncanny ability of music to shape destinies. ""Red Moon"" didn't just change my playlist; it changed my life."

BRO WE MAKIN OUT BLOOD MOON WITH THIS
"I am currently crying so hard right now. Lil Uzi Vert this is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was 1:12 . That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 2:14 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can't be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I've come across in my life and I'm definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece, I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul, and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on, gotta move on, as the song says. the chip is so inspirational, it shares it vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip. hail chip. hail chip. The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 1:42. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was at 1:12 . That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 1:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10 . chip spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on, gotta move on, as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational, it shares it vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip. hail chip. hail chip.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 3:05 . I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. well pleased like chip."
