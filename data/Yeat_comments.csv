I know you say you know me, I know you know you think you different
I know you think you gettin' a lot of money, you don't got no women

I don't wanna hear if you near me, no, I won't heal your soul

This song is a testament to the transformative power of art, fusing the traditional with the contemporary, poetry with rap, and uniting two seemingly disparate worlds in a seamless, groundbreaking manner. Yeats timeless verses, weaving them into a rhythmic and lyrical rap composition that pays homage to the poet's legacy. The rapper, skillfully intertwines words with the vibrant, pulsating beats of rap music. The song embodies a fusion that not only respects the essence of Yeats' poetry but also infuses it with a modern rhythm, reinvigorating the timeless themes and emotions encapsulated in the artists work. The rap song maintains the thematic richness of Yeats' poetry, delving into the poet's exploration of love, nature, the human condition, and the complexities of life. Through a dynamic flow of verses, Daddy Yeat captures the essence of Yeats' poetic vision, echoing the themes of societal change, the passage of time, and the interconnectedness between the past and the present. The brilliance of such art lies in the synergy between Yeats' lyrical genius and the rapper's deft use of rhythm and rhyme. Skillfully infusing the verses with contemporary cadence and lyrical acrobatics, maintaining the essence of Yeats' profound ideas while adapting them to the rhythmic structure of rap. The song's production value, characterized by its compelling beats and dynamic instrumental arrangements, elevates the fusion, offering a mesmerizing auditory experience that transcends boundaries and genres. Moreover, the song serves as a bridge between generations and cultures. It introduces a new audience to Yeats' timeless themes and poetic depth while simultaneously presenting rap enthusiasts with a unique and innovative approach to storytelling and lyricism. This cross-pollination of genres not only pays homage to Yeats' enduring legacy but also showcases the adaptability and universality of his themes in the context of modern music. Standing as a pioneering piece that redefines the boundaries of music and art, melding the timeless beauty of Yeats' poetry with the contemporary dynamism of rap. It is a bold and innovative creation that not only celebrates the literary genius of W.B. Yeats but also serves as a testament to the ever-evolving nature of artistic expression. Through this fusion, Yeat demonstrates that the resonance of Yeats' words are able to transcend time and form, finding a new life and relevance in the vibrant and expressive world of rap music. This song is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the conventional boundaries of music, enveloping the listener in an ethereal journey of sonic delight. Its symphonic arrangement is a tapestry of intricate melodies and harmonies that effortlessly blend together, creating a breathtaking musical landscape. The lyrics are poetic, weaving a narrative that resonates with the depths of human emotions, touching on themes of hope, resilience, and the pursuit of dreams. What truly sets this song apart is the impeccable craftsmanship in its composition—the seamless transition between hauntingly beautiful verses and an uplifting, powerful chorus that resonates with raw, unfiltered emotion. The instrumentation, from the haunting strings to the vibrant percussions, is a testament to the sheer artistry behind its creation. Its not just a song; it's an experience—an evocative journey that sparks the imagination, uplifts the spirit, and leaves an indelible mark on the soul of anyone who has the privilege of listening to it."

"Yeats, the renowned Irish poet, certainly isn't known for his prowess in the world of rap music. However, if we were to entertain the idea of him as a rapper, we might find some intriguing parallels between his poetry and the artistry of rap. Let's explore how Yeats could be viewed through the lens of rap.

Firstly, Yeats was a master of language. His poetry is celebrated for its rich imagery, intricate wordplay, and powerful use of symbolism. Similarly, rap as an art form relies heavily on lyricism and wordplay. Rappers often craft intricate rhymes and metaphors to convey their messages and tell stories. In this sense, Yeats' ability to manipulate language and create vivid imagery could translate well into the world of rap.

Furthermore, Yeats was deeply interested in exploring themes of identity, society, and the human experience in his poetry. These are also common themes in rap music. Rappers often use their lyrics to address issues such as social injustice, systemic oppression, and personal struggles. Yeats' exploration of these themes in his poetry could resonate with audiences of rap music, providing material for introspective and thought-provoking lyrics.

Moreover, Yeats was known for his innovative approach to poetic form. He experimented with various structures and meters, pushing the boundaries of traditional poetry. Similarly, rap is a genre that thrives on innovation and creativity. Rappers frequently incorporate diverse musical styles, rhythms, and flows into their music, constantly evolving the genre. Yeats' willingness to challenge conventions and explore new artistic territory could align well with the spirit of rap music.

Additionally, Yeats' poetry often has a rhythmic quality to it, with a musicality that lends itself to performance. While his work may not have been intended for musical accompaniment in the same way as rap lyrics, the cadence and rhythm of his writing could easily be adapted to fit a beat. Rappers often pay close attention to the flow and delivery of their lyrics, and Yeats' rhythmic verse could provide a strong foundation for rap performances.

In conclusion, while W.B. Yeats may not have been a rapper in the traditional sense, there are compelling parallels between his poetry and the artistry of rap music. His mastery of language, exploration of universal themes, innovative approach to form, and rhythmic writing style all suggest that Yeats could indeed be viewed as a ""good rapper"" in a metaphorical sense. Through this lens, we can appreciate the enduring relevance and versatility of his work across different artistic mediums."

"This whole album is unbelievable, so good to hear him taking risks and sounding more confident, cant wait to see where he goes with this"
"“And I could, if I would” I can’t wrap my head around that one"
This fire 🔥🔥🔥
"This video is a cinematic and videographic masterpiece in all aspects. It clearly conveys the vibes that the lyrics, the beat and Yeat are trying to give us.

I personally have a few favorite shots that I liked for multiple reasons, here's the list:
  • 0:40 to 0:41 the angled wide shot of Yeat just being alone with his thoughts with the refinery industrial complex at the back is just so poetic, truly a 2093 moment
  • 0:58 to 1:00 the still shot of the Skyline slowly driving away under the bridge is a metaphor for the things that sometimes escape our minds without us even noticing. Yeat is brilliant for thinking about how to implement such complicated truth into his visual art
  • 2:01 to 2:02 damn it man, the way Yeat is there, calmly yet in a confident way throwing away his cigar's ashes while the beat comes to a halt is insanely poetic. I interpret it as him saying that sometimes to be able to keep on moving, it's ok to first take a moment to breathe, a calm before the storm
  • 2:02 t0 2:05 Wow, just wow; the spiraling & approaching shot to Yeat is terrific in many ways, but I'll only list 1. It tells us that even tho we all may have troubles and problems to face, we, at the end of the day, gravitate to Yeat's music like a black hole that makes us feel just a tad bit better when we alas reach its event horizon"

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 0:45 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the chip is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip . hail chip. hail chip . The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 1:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. chip spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip . hail chip . hail chip. The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a chip do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 5:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. well pleased like chip. Thank you."

The evolution of his sound goin be studied
"In the vast tapestry of musical artistry, certain albums emerge as defining moments, transcending eras and leaving an indelible mark on culture. Yeat’s latest opus, 2093 undeniably ascends to this echelon of greatness, asserting its status as the quintessential album of the century. Through a kaleidoscope of innovative production, lyrical poignancy, and emotional depth, 2093 not only captivates listeners but also catalyzes profound introspection and personal transformation.

At the heart of 2093 lies a sonic journey that traverses the spectrum of human experience, offering a glimpse into the complexities of existence and the relentless pursuit of meaning. Among its constellation of tracks, Morë emerges as a shining beacon of artistic brilliance, encapsulating the album’s ethos with unparalleled resonance and emotional potency. As the album’s centerpiece, Morë embodies the essence of Yeat’s visionary artistry, serving as a catalyst for introspection and self-discovery.

Moreover, Morë transcends mere musical expression, evolving into a profound meditation on the fragility of human existence and the eternal search for meaning. Through its evocative lyricism and haunting melodies, the song serves as a mirror to the human soul, reflecting the universal yearning for transcendence and enlightenment. In the ethereal realms of Morë, listeners find solace amidst the chaos of existence, discovering moments of clarity and illumination amidst the darkness. 

In conclusion, Yeat’s 2093 stands as a testament to the transformative power of artistic expression, reshaping the sonic landscape of the century and beyond. Through its innovative production, poignant lyricism, and emotional depth, the album transcends mere musicality to become a catalyst for introspection and personal growth. And at the heart of this groundbreaking work lies Morë, a timeless masterpiece that embodies the album’s ethos with unparalleled brilliance and emotional resonance."

"I was but a destitute young man living off of leftover scraps from my father’s table in the year 1622. After hearing this song, I felt as if I had just had a red solo cup filled to the brim with nothing but the finest lean. After I replayed the song 69 times, a shining silver Tonka pulled into my driveway and I was transported to the Twizz planet and sent to the year 2093. Thank you Yeat, my life wouldn’t be the same without you."

"Back in 2024 I found elon musks teslabot69 GPT4.20 on his backroom. I went and teleport into an asteroid then cashout infinitillion amount of money making me the richest gigachad in 2024. After I smoke cigars with 22 hot chicks in my 10 Billion Super GigaYacht, I was curious about the potential of the Elon Musks teslabot69 GPT4.20 at that time. Then I went and teleport myself into 2093 where everything has evolved. I fly into the UFO sippin' my alien lean for the 1st time. 19 seconds later I heard this masterpiece in a distance while sippin' my 2nd alien lean then I float into another realm where I become the GOD myself. I went and become the GOD. I remember I still had my Elon Musks teslabot69 GPT4.20. And then I teleport into 9093. I'm still the GOD and have all the power in all across realms.

"I'm gonna be honest, this song is really nostalgic. I remember 32 years ago when my mother was still alive, she would always sing this song to me. She sang this song to me because my father always loved to listen to this song when he was feeling down. He suffered from depression heavily but this song always got him up, and now this song is doing the same for me. Thank you Yeat."

"I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the profound impact your music has had on my life. Your talent, dedication, and relentless pursuit of greatness have inspired me in ways I never thought possible.

Your music has been the soundtrack to my journey from poverty to prosperity. Through your lyrics and beats, I found the motivation and drive to push through adversity and chase my dreams relentlessly. Your stories of triumph over adversity resonated with me deeply, fueling my determination to create a better life for myself and my loved ones.

As I reflect on the transformational journey I've undertaken, I can't help but attribute much of my success to the inspiration I've drawn from your artistry. Your music served as a constant reminder that anything is possible with hard work, perseverance, and belief in oneself.

Thank you, Yeat, for sharing your gift with the world and for being a beacon of hope and inspiration to so many, myself included. Your music has not only enriched my life but has also played a pivotal role in my journey to financial abundance and personal fulfillment.

Thank you Noah Oliver Smith. ❤️"

I came to pick her up and I heard this masterpiece being blast on full volume. My ears were blessed so much it blasted me out the universe. I realized that my daughter would be safe in school with this action. She comes home everyday and starts blasting your music. she swerves the coupe. My life has changed big too. My money is big now and I’m blessed by Yeat. I thank God for providing us with Yeat and Yeat providing us with This. Thank you, Yeat."
