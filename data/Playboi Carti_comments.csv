"came here with my popcorn from that expose on him ripping off adin ross. never listened to the dudes music as i assumed being mainstream it would just be the same npc clone all corporate no heart bs auto tune and the same lyrical context and sounds being re fluffed and regurgitated. and ya apparently it is what i thought but seeing this dudes numbers i am confused...there is nothing here worth listening to. there are far better auto tune rappers out there. hell Ace NH is better then this dude, sure he is in prison for murder rn but he beat the first two murders where he shot two dudes point blank in the back of the head in a studio he was recording in. who knows he may walk on this one to, that chick was trying to trap him. and he has little to no views because people do not even look at underground stuff these days it seems. all just follow the herd smh. the only artists i don't mind auto tune on are the ones who do not even need it and just use it as it was meant to be. it is meant to compliment ones sound not be the entirety of it and their voice."

"turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven"

Fuk dis internet .
"Hello People of The World.

We are fighting the final war with satan and its fallen angels aka negative energy in the flesh  aka human body here on earth.

The Human Body is The Temple of God

Due to Sin, The Soul energy is positive and negative energy.
Energy CANNOT be destroyed, ONLY separated;
Therefore, choose this day which energy you will serve and be separated from and 4 eternity:

God = Life aka positive energy 

Satan = Death aka negative energy. 

The purpose of this life time is to defeat death aka negative energy aka satan to be allowed back in God's Heaven On Earth aka Paradise without Death aka Evil. 

The Key to open The Door / The Portal to enter God's Heaven On Earth aka Paradise is in The Bible. 

GOD is relationship, NOT religion.

Christians are the ONLY way to having a relationship with God and becoming a child of God. 

LIFE or DEATH 

Your Choice
And
Your free will

Jesus Christ is The Only Way, The Light, and The Truth.

ALL SINS CAN BE FORGIVEN
So don't be left behind in Darkness
And
Seek God's forgiveness today.

Sincerity,
A Friend."
"Hello Playboi Carty, Travis Scott and EVERYONE behind your music productions,

As Your God,
As Your Lord, 
As Your King,
And
As A Child Of God,
I CANNOT sing, play, NOR dance to your music
4
Your Music
 and
Your images do NOT Glorify The Image and likness of A Child Of God. 

I pray in Jesus name that EVERYONE who works behind  your music production and yourself come into repantance

Your souls do NOT glorifying God's Heaven On Earth Entertainment. 

Sincerity,
GOD's Warrior and Angel."

They got money on your top, who say you can't buy health? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need a thicky, need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like improve somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)

"Heavily auto tuned. Can understand a fraction of the words. What you can understand means absolutely nothing at all. The beat is thrown together. MF dressed like Balenciaga Batman.

This is what's popular now, and it drives me up the fucking wall. My morning glory has more creativity than anything in this ""music"" video. I listen to new music all the time. This and stuff like this I honestly struggle to find anything creative or any form of art, and I just can't. 

Remember ""in da club?"" That song is just oozing art and creativity. The lyrical rhythm changing, the feel of the song, everything is just awesome. Man On The Moon, an album that I consider to this day a masterpiece of this genre, where the rhythm and words sync together in both tone and context so well it hits home differently for everyone. 

What. The. Fuck. What happened to hip hop and rap? What is this thrown together bullshit that is making these hacks ungodly amounts of money?"

"To me, Cartis music sounds like every dude who’s commenting “I’m and up in coming rapper🔥💯 please go and listen” 
Then you listen to the booty cheeks ass song they have out on soundcloud and some cringe lip sync triller video"
Spotify ?
""
U song sucks bro
This song lasted longer than the stream with Adin Ross😂😂
This the Carti I been wanting and waiting for 💯🔥🖤
Fuck me this is horrible. Smoking weed and experiencing this music is a nightmare trip
"This, apparently, is “real rap” today guys………. 😂😂😂 Hip Hop is a joke these days. Tupac would be rolling in his grave seeing this……."
How is he famous? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This man stole Young Thug’s flow and everything and made it his own. Idk how you people listen to complete unoriginality….. Can barely even understand and comprehend the guy…….
"Playboy Carti wearing a witch outfit, spitting spells.

cant make this shit up!"
We won’t get arrested with this one 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥

L playboi carti
this is garbage mumble rap

He from duck tape entertainment
Omg such shit
Who is the chick in braids?
"If Playboi Carti shits, I flush. If Playboi Carti sneezes, I bless him. If Playboi Carti farts, I inhale. When Playboi Carti points I look. When Playboi Carti talks I listen. When Playboi Carti commands, I obey. If there are 1 million fans of Playboi Carti, I am one of them, if there are 1 thousand fans, I am apart of them, if Playboi Carti only had one fan, that is me. If Playboi Carti has no fans then there is no ME.
If Playboi Carti doesn't exist, I don't exist. If Playboi Carti doesn't breathe, don't breathe.
To the deaf he is the voice. To the blind he is the vision. To the thirsty he is the oasis. To the greedy he is the treasure. To the angels he is God. But if you question me, what am I to Playboi Carti you ask? I am his number one fan."
Travis carried big time good song but Travis should’ve took a back seat lol he didn’t have to kill this track like that

Thank you for this exquisite song, I will never forget this experience."

"My current age is 3 (three) years old of age. Back in '04 when my younger brother was born, at first he wasn't breathing and they couldn't get him to take a breath for like 5 years or something but then they played this absolute b-b-b-banger and he finally decided the beautiful moment of his first breath was worthy of this as a song to be engraved in his memories and written about in his autobiography which he will send to National Geographic to write and produce a video documentary. Appreciate it, Carti!"

My sister had cancer and the doctor said there was nothing he could do and she only had months to live. We went home and threw her a party to cheer her up and played this song in the party playlist. As soon as the song was over she stood up saying she felt a weird sensation. We went back to the doctor to have her looked at. The doctor examined her and after running extensive tests and scans he came back in the room with a puzzled look on his face and said only three words. “The cancer’s gone” This song saved my sisters life 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿

Hardest shit i ever heard
Shitttttt out
"As a 25 y/o former rap fan that checks in every so often, I don’t even know where to begin on this one. The most glaring problems with this video are that he just uses Future’s flow to pull a “ ‘member berries” on you and convince you that this is good music, and then he’s wearing the most insane, opulent, out of touch with reality, “eyes wide shut” outfit you could possibly imagine"
i like carti but not a big fan of this song ngl

"turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven"

And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my Demmo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot

I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need a thicky, need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like improve somethin', just don't you remove nothin'(Don't you do it)

"i like this song and ""FEIN"" i should listen to more song of him .... for fans of carti do you have recommendation of songs ?"
Saw this liveee at trav in toronto dude was unreal
yuh
Travis part was pure sickness only in a dope ASF way ya 👍😜
"You probably don't wanna be a carti fan, but you should be. You'll wear it like a medal because you learned the ""Vamp Anthem"" in school. You'll casually slide in the fact that you're a ""FE!N"" for carti, and you'll look studious. When you become a carti fan, you'll go through a ""M3tamorphosis"" and fly high in the sky, where you'll make her scream when you fuck."
Travis Scott part was not needed
"I almost killed myself last night, i’ve been addicted to opiates and weed ever since i was 15 and my life seemed almost over for me, the only happiness i felt was from the drugs. However as soon as i heard this song all of a sudden life is worth living sober!!!! thank you mr carti 🙏🙏"
I like how ice spice's ass is the most replayed part
TRAVIS Scott IM YOUR BIGGEST Fn
"Gay Version: 

In the Middle of a „Phil“ , throw me a boy ,
I‘m doing this boy like a quarterback,
Stayin in the „Phil“ , holding a Ball
Go in that hole like a quarterback 🧛🏾‍♀️🏳️‍🌈"
"I was in the navy for 15 years, Purple Heart badge and all, I watched my stepfather get blown to smithereens and playing this song recollected his atoms back into human form, thank you carti my mom can be happy again!"
I’m another shitty single away from admitting that he’ll never get any better than “Die Lit” that album was fire

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pop, oh, yeah, yeah

Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck, they givin' that)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a lil' iffy, need a thickie, need her to move somethin'
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Girl like a zoo jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two comin', double, double, quick drummin' (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback

Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

Still number 8 trending
WHO IS LISTENING TO THIS IN 2024?🙏🗣🔥🔥
Some one extend this song plz
We making it till cartis album with this one
"Anyone see how Carti's birth year just changed from 1996 to 1995, ever since his records during 2022 arrest were leaked? He even said ""1995"" in the arrest, and all records say it too. So, was claiming 1996/09/13, nothing but a promo for the ""Tupac resurrected"" claim? Just a marketing ploy? Or why is his birthday suddenly changed to 1995??... (if you didn't know the Tupac theory; evidence comes from the birth mark Carti has on his face right where Tupac took a bullet through the cheek, as well as his birthday being the day Tupac died, as justifications for Carti being Tupac's resurrection)"
Ken?
realistically this fucking sucks
0:41 É ele ali o gigante ?? Flamengo ...
Tbh Travis didn't use his full potential on this. Imagine him with the Days before Rodeo Era. Something like Skyfall.
looks like carti gonna use his normal voice in his song
Old school carti was okay then he became baby voice carti now he sounds like he smoked 2 much of cigarettes. I mean why do rappers chase something they aren’t. Disgusting
I'm highly aoutistic  and I find this a banger 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥

"Pls drop the dates for the antagonist tour, I been waiting since September and been edging dog, I need to need uuu 😭"
"Cartis lame nowadays, it blows my mind some dudes will listen to this and truly think it’s heat. Bogus. I like cartis soundcloud upbringing and his first two albums because that’s when he was truly hungry for this shit. Carti doesn’t give a fuck about music anymore and you can tell by this awful production. For those of you like myself who listened to him heavy up until 2019 then turned your cheek from his career but followed it from a distance know. 
Damn shame. 
No pun intended. And that’s my favorite song by carti ~ Damn shame"

"Absolute garbage as usual. The fact people made this guy with zero talent one of the biggest ""rap"" artists blows my mind. I really have an open mind and tried with whole lotta red listening to the whole thing a couple times while working to see what all these people see but hes just terrible. Literally one of the worst artists ever in the history of the world and somehow he has this insane cult following. He should be at the level the island boys are at, his talent level matches up perfectly with thise 2 little herbs."

"Dear Jordan Terrell Carter,

I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the incredible impact your music has had on my life and how it has helped me overcome my struggles. Your music has been a source of inspiration, solace, and motivation during some of the most challenging times I've faced.

Your songs, with their heartfelt lyrics and captivating melodies, have been a constant companion and a source of comfort when I needed it the most. They resonated with my own experiences and emotions, making me feel understood and less alone in my struggles.

Your music has the power to uplift my spirits, bring me solace in times of sorrow, and provide the motivation I needed to keep pushing forward.

"Thank You Sir Carti !!!❤ My son Conner has been a fan of your art since ""Magnolia"" - by You of course😊. With the unfortunate fact that Conner has been fighting 'asbestos'' (A flesh-eating lung cancer) since he was 2yrs, he is now all better and healthy and is going to school full time. All because of one human being, and that would be You, King Carti.🙌🏾🙇🏾‍♂️🔯🖖👁️"

"Esta canción literalmente me salvó la vida. Hace 27 años estaba a punto de dejar este mundo cruel cuando esta bofetada llegó a mi altavoz por intervención divina. ""Lanzar esa azada como un mariscal de campo"" tocó mi alma profundamente y me hizo llorar, y encontré una nueva esperanza. Gracias Travis, te debo mi vida y la de mis familiares."
"This song literally saved my life. 27 years ago I was ready to depart this cruel world when this slapper came onto my speaker by divine intervention. “Throwin that hoe like a quarterback” touched my soul deep and brought a tear to my eye, and I found new hope. Thank you Travis, I owe you my life and next of kin."

"When I was about 15, my pops told me that I couldn’t make it. So I manifested that. Since then I’ve been homeless and living on the streets. I’ve tried to hop couch to couch for 7 years and I even trained me a pet raccoon and named him Damien. That’s my dawg fasho. However, it wasn’t until I heard this song  that I realized time is running out. And right now anything is possible. And you know what dad…. I CAN make it. Me and Damien have been deeply inspired by this masterpiece Mr.Carti."

"Nothing new to see here, hip-hop and rap are not changing.  2024 is the year we wake up and start calling an end to this.
Endless use of the n-word for black people; endless use of the b-word for women;  an intense obsession with guns, with violence in all forms, with drug-selling and drug-taking, with money and material things."
I was just in the spot with my pops… my grandma still play bingo??? I need the lyrics

"Every day I feel bored, just listening to this song improves my mood significantly. Music is truly magical!"
"Playboi Carti, a maestro in the realm of contemporary music, has once again bestowed upon us a sonic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of conventional sound. The release of his latest song not only reverberates through our eardrums but also leaves an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. In an era where musical expression serves as a conduit for emotions and societal reflections, Playboi Carti emerges as a trailblazer, pushing the boundaries of creativity. The gratitude we extend is not just for dropping a song, but for crafting an auditory experience that resonates with the zeitgeist of our time. Carti's sonic tapestry is woven with intricate beats, poetic lyrics, and an avant-garde approach to music production. With each release, he invites us into his world, a place where beats and verses collide to create a harmonious chaos that mirrors the complexity of our lives. It is a testament to his artistry that he can evoke emotions and provoke thought through the medium of sound. Beyond the beats and lyrics, Playboi Carti's contribution extends to the cultural dialogue. His work becomes a shared experience, a common ground where listeners from diverse backgrounds find unity in the rhythm. In a world often divided, music becomes the unifying force, and Carti's latest offering is a testament to the power of artistic expression in fostering connection. As listeners, we find solace and inspiration in the melodies crafted by Playboi Carti. Whether it's the infectious energy of an upbeat track or the introspective mood of a slower tempo, his music has the power to uplift, console, and transport us to a different realm. The gratitude expressed is not just for the song itself but for the emotional journey it facilitates. In the fast-paced landscape of the music industry, artists often become the architects of our memories. Each song marks a moment in time, a soundtrack to our lives. Playboi Carti's latest release is not merely a song but a chapter in the collective story of those who listen. It becomes a bookmark, a musical notation in the symphony."
"Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day"
this song reminds me of my piano teacher. she died in 1984. i sometimes come back to this video just to remember her. she was such a sweet woman and would always teach me how to play her favorite songs and this is one of them. song is truly a time tested classic!
Who's got the better verse ?
"""I THINK I NEED ME A ICE SPICE, YEAH I WANT ME A MUNCH""🔥"
"[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me, what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Yo, fuck this internet, ha-ha)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy health? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need a thicky, need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like improve somethin', just don't you remove nothin'(Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback"
"Yeah, yeah
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)

"'Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.   (Psalm 50:22)
'Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.   (Lamentations 2:19)
'Remember Lot’s wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.   (Luke 17:32-33)
'I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.   (Psalm 16:7)
- Since Christ my soul from sin set free, This world has been a Heaven to me; And 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe, 'Tis heaven my Jesus here to know. O hallelujah, yes, 'tis heaven 'Tis heaven to know my sins forgiven; On land or sea, what matters where? Where Jesus is, 'tis Heaven there."
I remember listening to this song while beating my wife she said turn that sh!t up n hit harder

"In the vast universe filled with countless planets, there existed a mysterious and eerie world known as Cabblepach. This planet was shrouded in darkness and had a reputation for its unique and unsettling features.  The skies of Cabblepach were a deep crimson red, casting an ominous glow over the desolate landscape. Thick, pitch-black clouds swirled above, obscuring the few rays of light that managed to penetrate through. The air was heavy with an otherworldly silence, as if the planet itself held a secret waiting to be discovered.  The grass on Cabblepach was unlike anything found on other worlds. Its color was a dull gray, devoid of life and vibrancy. As one walked through the fields, the ground would emit a soft crunching sound, indicating the brittle and lifeless nature of the terrain. It was a stark contrast to the lush greenery found on most planets, evoking a sense of unease in those who dared to tread upon it.  The waters of Cabblepach were perhaps the most unsettling aspect of all. They flowed blood-red, resembling a thick and sticky substance, similar to maple syrup. The rivers and lakes that crisscrossed the planet's surface seemed to defy all natural laws, as if they held a dark secret hidden beneath their surface.  Despite the foreboding nature of Cabblepach, it was not entirely devoid of life. Strange and unique creatures adapted to this harsh environment, their forms an eerie reflection of the planet's unsettling features. Their eyes glowed with an eerie red hue, and their movements were slow and deliberate, as if they were in tune with the mysterious energy that permeated the planet.  Legend had it that Cabblepach was once a thriving and vibrant world, until a cataclysmic event changed its fate forever. The planet was consumed by a dark force, corrupting the very eccense of the world a witch brought it into the planet with her spelled cursing it for entirety.

gotta respect carti for coming out with a unique sound. travis came on with the same sound and flow that has made hits since 2017 and just sounds so goddam boring at this point
"Hello, Jordan Terrell Carter and Jacques Bermon Webster II, I would like to say that this track that I have listened to has cured me from my stage 5 cancer, just by hearing Jordan Terrell Carter speak. Next that happened is once Jacques Bermon Webster II appeared upon this track with his vocal skills, it instantly cured my depression and illnesses. Finally once I saw Jacques Bermon Webster II and Jordan Terrell Carter in the music video together, I believe world hunger began to end as everybody realized this is our food, our grind, and our soul. I sincerely thank you Jordan Terrell Carter and Jacque Bermon Webster II for this music video and music track, as it clearly saved lives and changed mine."

"Dear Jordan Carter,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my immense gratitude for your latest song, ""BCKR00MS."" Its arrival in my life couldn't have been more timely, nor its impact more profound. As a young man navigating the labyrinth of life, your music has been a guiding light, illuminating paths I never knew existed. Your song isn't just a melodic masterpiece; it's a tapestry woven with authenticity, vulnerability, and an unwavering honesty that resonates deeply within me. The way you articulate the complexities of the human experience, the highs and lows, the struggles and triumphs, is nothing short of a revelation. ""BCKR00MS"" speaks a language that transcends mere lyrics; it speaks directly to the soul. In a world where confusion often reigns and clarity feels elusive, your music acts as a compass, pointing towards self-discovery and introspection. It's as though you've managed to capture the essence of the inner turmoil I've grappled with—the feelings of being lost and misguided—in a three-minute masterpiece. Listening to ""BCKR00MS"" feels like having a conversation with an old friend who understands every unsaid word, every unspoken fear. The depth of emotion conveyed through your music is awe-inspiring. It's more than just a song; it's a catalyst for growth. It's prompted me to confront my uncertainties, to embrace my vulnerabilities, and to acknowledge that the journey towards self-improvement isn't a straight path but a series of twists and turns, much like the melodies in your composition. Your artistry has given me solace in moments of confusion and strength in moments of weakness. It's provided a soundtrack to my contemplations, a backdrop against which I've begun to paint a clearer picture of who I am and who I aspire to become. ""BCKR00MS"" isn't just a song on repeat; it's a companion on a transformative voyage. Your ability to create music that speaks directly to the human experience is a rare gift, and I'm immensely grateful for your willingness to share it with the world. Your authenticity and vulnerability have inspired me to embrace my own story, to celebrate the highs and learn from the lows, understanding that each note in life's symphony contributes to the beauty of the whole. In closing, I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation for your artistry. Your music has been a beacon of hope in my life, guiding me through the labyrinth of uncertainty. Thank you for creating ""BCKR00MS"" and for being a source of inspiration, guidance, and comfort."

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at
6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.
I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can't be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human.
Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This miaht be the most impactful piece of art l've come across in my life, and I'm definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece, I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul, and i don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on, gotta move on, as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational, it shares it vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music...
This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece.
Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist. empathizina her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.1 am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this.
Not even to mention the most incredible part that is

"There are songs that transcend mere listening to become sensory and emotional experiences, and ""Backrooms"" by Playboi Carti is a poignant example of this. From the first notes, a captivating melody takes hold of the listener, like a melancholy floating in the air. The gentle beats and sublime harmonies create a unique sonic landscape that immerses the listener in an ocean of emotions.

The title itself, ""Backrooms,"" evokes a hidden dimension, a secret and intimate part of the human soul. The lyrics, though often enigmatic, reveal a touching vulnerability. One can feel the weight of lived experiences, buried memories, and perhaps even regrets. Playboi Carti shares his thoughts in a raw and sincere manner, revealing a part of himself that he may not have exposed before.

Through each note, one can almost sense the artist's soul expressing itself, as if opening the doors to his inner world. The nuances of his voice, at times deep and at times soft, resonate with poignant authenticity. There seems to be a certain introspection, a search for meaning, emanating from every whispered word.

""Backrooms"" is an invitation to delve into the emotional intimacy of Playboi Carti. It's a shared experience between the artist and the listener, a connection that goes beyond mere lyrics. The track creates a space where emotions are free to express themselves, where each person can lose and find themselves through the music.

Ultimately, ""Backrooms"" transcends the boundaries of a simple song to become an ode to human fragility, self-discovery, and the emotional power of music. It's a bold and touching work of art that leaves an indelible mark on those who immerse themselves in it, reminding us that music has the unique power to touch hearts and evoke profound emotions."

"My 90 year old grandmother was on her death bed, and on her last breath she asked me to lean in and she whispered in my ear “Play backrooms by carti” and as soon as I played it she inhaled a deep breath, took off her breathing tubes and poured a double cup of wok, hopped in her Trackhawk, and is back and better than before! All thanks to  carti! You saved my grandma!"

People never fail to amaze me 😂. People like carti's baby fetus voice on pain 1993 with drake but hate this? In my opinion this not as bad as that but i enjoy carti so i might be biased. Plus the beat is 🔥
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it’s to late. ⏳

Opium takeover 2024.
"Zeznanie córki ofiary
13 grudnia 2022 roku, Han Yu, mieszkanka Nowego Jorku, została zapytana w talk show Ricka Jensena  o swojego ojca, pana Han Junqing, który był praktykującym Falun Gong w mieście Doudian w dzielnicy Fangshan w Pekinie. Pan Han został aresztowany w lutym 2004 roku za trzymanie się swojej wiary i zmarł 4 maja, trzy miesiące później. Setki policjantów zostało wysłanych do skremowania jego ciała bez zgody jego rodziny, próbując ukryć przestępstwo przymusowego pobierania organów.

„Kiedy zobaczyłam ciało mojego ojca, nie mogłam uwierzyć, że jest prawdziwe - był wychudzony i pokryty siniakami. Na jego twarzy brakowało jednego dużego obszaru skóry i miał wiele ran"" - wspominała jego córka.

Jensen, laureat nagrody Philadelphia Region Society of Professional Journalists za najlepszy talk show, od ponad 20 lat demaskuje brutalność KPCH, w tym zbrodnię przymusowego pobierania organów.


Han Yu przemawiała podczas drugiego dorocznego Międzynarodowego Szczytu Wolności Religijnej (IRF)

Na temat swojego ojca Han Yu zeznawała również na drugim dorocznym Międzynarodowym Szczycie Wolności Religijnej. Pan Han cierpiał na chorobę serca, miał wysokie ciśnienie krwi i pęcherze na obu nogach. Po tym jak zaczął praktykować Falun Gong, dolegliwości te zostały wyleczone bez leczenia medycznego. Przestał również palić i wyeliminował napady złego humoru.

Pani Han przypomniała co widziała w 2004 roku, po śmierci ojca : „Widziałam jego ciało, zanim zostało skremowane. Był strasznie chudy i cały posiniaczony. Było tam nacięcie rozciągające się od gardła aż do brzucha. Nacięcie było zaszyte czarną nicią. Ucisnęliśmy jego brzuch i mogliśmy wyczuć pod skórą twardy blok lodu"".

Dwa lata później (w 2006 roku) przymusowe pobieranie organów przez KPCh zostało ujawnione społeczności międzynarodowej. Dopiero wtedy rodzina pana Hana zdała sobie sprawę, że jego organy zostały najprawdopodobniej pobrane.

"Travis Scott is a government plant, a worker of spiritual wickedness! America is mystery Babylon and it's going to send many to the lake of fire peacefully!!! The youth that grew into this are being weaponized for destruction. Trump Biden Obama and all the kings of the earth are making man war against one another for their gain and humor! DO NOT TRUST THESE DEMONS, THEY DO NOT TRULY CARE ABOUT YOU, THEY WANT YOUR SOUL TO JOIN THEM!"

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you"

This guy is cooking shit on fire
Carti’s deep voice sounds like Lil Yachty and I can’t unhear it.
"As a fan of Playboi Carti, I have personally experienced the impact his music can have on a person's life. One of the ways that his music has affected me is by providing me with a sense of motivation and energy. Whenever I listen to Playboi Carti's music, I feel a surge of excitement and confidence. His upbeat and confident tone reflects his own persona as an artist, and it's contagious. For me, this energy is especially helpful when I'm feeling low on motivation or struggling with self-doubt. Playboi Carti's music can provide a much-needed boost of energy and encouragement, inspiring me to pursue my passions and take on challenges with renewed vigor.

Furthermore, Playboi Carti's music has helped me overcome adversity by providing me with a sense of hope and resilience. I appreciate the fact that Playboi Carti often talks about the struggles he faced in his own life, including poverty, rejection, and self-doubt. However, his lyrics often reflect his determination to overcome these obstacles and pursue his dreams. This message can be inspiring for listeners who may be facing their own challenges. Playboi Carti's music can provide a sense of hope and optimism, reminding me that I too can overcome adversity and achieve my goals.

In addition, listening to Playboi Carti has helped me express myself creatively. Playboi Carti's music is often characterized by its eccentricity and experimentalism, which I find inspiring as a creative person. His willingness to push boundaries and take risks can encourage me to embrace my own creativity and pursue my own artistic visions. This has been particularly empowering for me as a young person who often feels pressure to conform to societal norms. Playboi Carti's music has encouraged me to embrace my own unique style and express myself in my own way.

Overall, listening to Playboi Carti has had a significant impact on my life. His music has provided me with a sense of motivation and energy, helped me overcome adversity, and encouraged me to express myself creatively. I am grateful for the positive influence his music has had on my life, and I look forward to seeing how his music continues to evolve and inspire listeners in the future."

"Dear Jordan Terrell Carter,

I hope this message finds you surrounded by the same positive vibes your music effortlessly radiates into the world. I couldn't resist taking a moment to express my immense gratitude for the incredible musical journey you've taken us on with your recent releases. Your artistry transcends boundaries, weaving a tapestry of emotions that resonates not just with fans but, I'm convinced, even with pigeons! Your latest songs are like a sonic elixir, sprinkled with a magical blend of love, humor, and gratitude. They're not just tunes; they're a testament to your creativity and the profound impact that music can have on our collective soul. In a world that can sometimes feel chaotic and overwhelming, your music serves as a comforting embrace, a reminder that even in the midst of challenges, we can find joy, laughter, and connection. I swear, your songs have the power to make pigeons dance on city streets, spreading feathered joy to everyone around! And let's not forget the part about saving the USA. Your music has this uncanny ability to bring people together, to bridge gaps and foster a sense of unity. It's like a musical superhero cape, swooping in to save the day, one beat at a time. If the world were a stage, your music would be the spotlight, illuminating the path to a better, brighter future. Thank you, Jordan, for being a beacon of positivity and creativity. Your tunes have become the soundtrack to countless moments of our lives, turning ordinary days into extraordinary memories. Your artistry is a gift to the world, and we're all better for having the privilege of experiencing it. Keep doing what you do, and know that your fans, human and pigeon alike, are here cheering you on. May your melodies continue to echo through the streets, lifting spirits and bringing smiles to faces around the globe."

"Ever since the age of 6 i’ve been a raging alcoholic. It’s gotten so bad, by the age of 7, I was snorting coke and smoking meth. Until my pet goldfish, Jermiqiua Carmen, introduced to me your music Sir Cartier. I’m now 29 years old and in rehab. Your music has truly changed my life. I now have a wife and 2 kids. Both of which are named after you. I sing “Rockstar made” to my kids every night before bed. Truly, thank you carti. I am in debt to you for the rest of my life."

And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need a thicky, need her to move somethin' (Iffy)

"As the sun beamed down on Bethlehem, marking the historic birth of Jesus, the world sighed in heavenly relief. It was a day etched in history, surrounded by angels, shepherds, and the three wise men.

Fast forward to the present day, where I stumbled upon a celestial artifact—an ancient scroll that seemed to pre-date parchment paper. The inscription read, ""BACKR00MS"" by Playboi Carti, released on that very day of miraculous birth.

Intrigued by the divine connection between trap beats and biblical times, I decided to play the ancient scroll on a phonograph that looked suspiciously like a manger. As the celestial notes filled the room, an unexpected wave of holiness washed over me. The music, seemingly transcending eras, transported me back to a time of miracles, where water turned into wine and loaves multiplied faster than bunnies.

Playboi Carti's ""BACKR00MS"" became a divine intervention, a groove-worthy bridge that transcended space and time. The rhythm and lyrics made me envision angels breakdancing on clouds, and the three wise men dropping their gifts to do the milly rock. It was a soundtrack to the birth of cool, a divine jam that united heaven and earth in harmonious celebration.

Interestingly, the release of this heavenly tune on the very day of Jesus' birth felt like a cosmic playlist, a celestial mixtape dropped for a world hungry for joy and holy vibes. The catchy tunes became a holy conduit, allowing me to visualize the scenes of that historic manger party, reminding me of a time when the world marvelled at a newborn king and dropped beats in unison."
🗑 🚮 I know it sounds cliche at this point but I miss the old 2015-2016 carti haven't been fw him since this new transitioning voice

"As the sun rose in the early hours of September 2nd, 1945, marking the long-awaited end of World War II, the world sighed in relief. It was a day etched in history as the first day of peace after years of conflict that had torn nations apart.

Decades later, in the present day, amidst the hustle of daily life, I stumbled upon a hidden treasure—an old vinyl record that bore the title ""BACKR00MS"" by Playboi Carti, released on that very day of peace in 1945.

Curiosity led me to play the vintage record on an ancient phonograph. As the crackling notes and timeless melody filled the room, an unexpected wave of nostalgia washed over me. The music, seemingly ahead of its time, beckoned my memory back to an era of hope, unity, and restored peace.

The rhythm and lyrics of Playboi Carti's ""BACKR00MS"" became a bridge, transporting me to a bygone era where the world had just emerged from the shadows of war. The music encapsulated the jubilant spirit of that historic day, where people danced in the streets, celebrating the dawn of a new and peaceful chapter.

Intriguingly, the song's release on that momentous day felt like a deliberate gift to a world hungry for joy and harmony. Its catchy tune and beats became a conduit, allowing me to once again visualise the scenes of post-war elation, reminding me of a time when the world came together in shared relief and happiness."

"63 year old war veteran here. Lifes been tough on me ever since I got back from deployment, i have been suffering with PTSD and nightmares daily. After hearing this song, I crabbed some of the xanax my doctor prescribed for my anxiety caused by PTSD, grabbed a bottle of smirnoff, and drove down to vegas to gamble all the rest of my money away, I know I'm just one visit away from hitting the big win. This song confirmed my good fortune in 2024. This song has changed this old war veterans life and gave it a new meaning. Now instead of spending my days trying to cope with the memories of war, I spend my days drinking at the casino patiently waiting for Playboi Carti's next album. That day will be a good one..."

"Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah

And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my Demmo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch



[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, he need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's—)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback

"Hello, Humans 
Others run but you need to run faster. Never slow down for weak minded humans who are programmed.

TERRANCE OUT"
My grandmother said its lit 🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯
"It was an ordinary day when my brother, struggling with autism, stumbled upon the track ""BackR00ms"" by Playboi Carti. As the vibrant beats and rhythmic flow filled the room, something magical happened. Mesmerized by the music, my brother's world seemed to transform.

With each note, he began to move, swaying in harmony with the melody. His eyes lit up with newfound joy as if the music was unlocking a door to a world he hadn't known existed. Slowly, he started expressing himself, mimicking the dance moves from the music video, his movements fluid and free.

The music seemed to speak to him in a language only he could understand. It tapped into something deep within him, gradually easing the barriers that held him back. Day by day, the changes became apparent - he started making eye contact, engaging in conversations, and even expressing his emotions in ways he never had before.

The transformative power of ""BackR00ms"" seemed inexplicable, yet undeniably real. People around him noticed the remarkable transformation, marveled by the positive changes in his behavior and communication skills. Doctors were astonished at his progress, unable to explain how this particular track seemed to resonate so deeply with him.

My brother's journey was one of incredible transformation, all catalyzed by the mesmerizing rhythm and lyrics of ""BackR00ms."" Though the journey of living with autism may have been challenging, the discovery of this song became the catalyst for his newfound ability to express himself and engage more fully with the world around him."
Cadi seems complete insane. How it should be. fucking nice 😵

"1998, used to work in a jazz club in Paris as a bartender. It was a tough time personally, I had a day job too, and my personal life was kind of a ruin. The bar would be empty when the concert was on, but I could hear just fine. When the band played this, tears gushed out of my eyes and I crumbled, and silently sobbed my heart out alone.. It helped me heal."

"Jordan Carter, your music has become the lifeline that pulls me through the ebb and flow of existence. In the tumultuous sea of life's challenges, your melodies are the constant waves that carry me forward. It's more than just music; it's a beacon of hope guiding me through the darkest nights and the stormiest days.

When the weight of the world feels too heavy to bear, your songs become the sturdy pillars supporting the fragile structure of my resilience. Each note is a reminder that I am not alone in this journey, that someone out there understands the complexities of life's struggles, and has translated them into a beautiful symphony that resonates with my very soul.

Your lyrics are not merely words; they are mantras that echo in my mind during moments of despair, reminding me to persevere and find strength in vulnerability. Your music has stitched together the broken fragments of my spirit, creating a mosaic of emotions that reflect the shared human experience.

In times of joy, your tunes amplify the elation, turning simple moments into unforgettable memories. Your artistry transforms mundane routines into cinematic sequences, infusing every day with a sense of purpose and significance. It's as if your music has the power to elevate the mundane to the extraordinary.

Jordan, you may not be aware, but your creativity has been a lifeline for me. Your songs have been the backdrop to both my triumphs and tribulations, creating a soundtrack to my life that intertwines with every heartbeat. Thank you for being the artist whose work is not just heard but felt, and for being the tether that keeps me grounded in the symphony of life."

I own 47 gold teslas, 28 Bugatti’s, 13 Lambos, My own private apache helicopter, 3 yachts and a island. Thank you for inspiring me to achieve my dreams.

Later i moved into a house with my uncle and ant. i was bitten by a weird spider and later seen the same robber that killed my parents. This same man went and shot my uncle while he was looking for me. He said “with great power comes great responsibility.” I think about this quote a lot. It reminds me of you carti. Thank you for dropping this music and taking my mind off of everything going on."

Cardo x Carti album?? 😳🔥
"My sister, an aspiring 25-year-old musician, would strum her guitar, playing this soulful melody every Sunday afternoon in our small backyard. This tune carried with it a mix of joy and nostalgia, echoing through the neighborhood. Those musical moments transport me back to lazy weekends, surrounded by the warmth of family and the gentle notes that seemed to linger in the air. This is a melody etched in my memory, a soundtrack to the treasured times we shared."

Decent song."
"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined african tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical african war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 african tribes/10 african tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."

Carti and Travis in the backrooms before GTA 6 naa 💀
This sound like young thug but worse.
This song is amazing but it missing a “ITS LIT”😭
This shit so hard
"Life, much like Playboi Carti's 'Backr00ms,' is a symphony of highs and lows, beats and breaks. In the rhythm of existence, we find ourselves navigating through the backrooms of our journey, where the melody of challenges and the harmony of victories intertwine. Just like Carti's unique sound, your life is a composition that only you can create.

When the bass drops and the tempo quickens, remember that every setback is a setup for a comeback. Life's remixes might throw unexpected beats your way, but it's your resilience that turns them into the most captivating verses. Embrace the unknown and dance through the uncertainties, for it is in the backrooms of life that we discover our true strength.

Play your life's track loud, let the beats of determination and passion guide you. Just as Carti explores the unconventional in his music, dare to be different, embrace your individuality, and turn your struggles into stepping stones toward greatness. The backr00ms of life may seem dim at times, but it's in those moments that you find the brightest sparks of your own brilliance.

So, let the rhythm of your heart propel you forward, and remember: Life is your stage, and you are the artist. With each step, you're creating a masterpiece, a composition that resonates with the unique symphony that is you. Keep playing your tune, and let the world hear the extraordinary melody that only you can bring to life."

"Jordan Carter,

I wanted to let you know the impact your recent song had on me. Seriously, it's been a game-changer in my life. The beats, the lyrics, the vibe—everything about it resonated with me on a whole new level. Your music has this unique power to transport me to another state of mind; this latest track did just that.

It's crazy how a few minutes of music can hit you in a way that alters your perspective, energizes you, and even provides comfort during tough times. Your artistry goes beyond just entertainment; it catalyzes inspiration and self-reflection for so many.

I just wanted to express my gratitude for creating something that not only sounds amazing but also can reach people on a deeper level. Keep doing what you're doing because your music isn't just a song—it's a soundtrack to moments, memories, and personal growth.

Thank you for sharing your talent and passion with the world."

I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe,"

I remember eating 13 ice cubes right after playing football in my yard. This song truly made me feel the strongest of emotions that I have felt in a while. It motivated me at 5:38 pm to get on the ground and do exactly 26 push ups. After I decided to do a plank for around 2 minutes. Thank you for this motivation mr carter.

I understood his wish and played thIS song for him. He instantly perked up, sang along, and put on his vamp hat. He then rode his wheelchair out of the hospital. You are awesome! You healed my cousin! Now drop the whole album i want to revive all of em!"
6.1 M in 1 day is crazy
ok
Thank Travis for ruining this🔥🔥🔥
I come back to this every year
"If carti can do it with this trash. Whoever you are, you can too❤"
This the future influence
Now we made it but the last thing that we need is CARTI X YEAT
Why tf wont Carti use his real voice
This song changed my life for the better. It set me on my path to become what I am today. I was but a boy when the melody entered my ears for the first time. That boy is now a man. Thank Mr. Carter 🙏🙏🥵🕊🕊🧛🏿‍♂️🧛🏿‍♂️

"Dear Mr. Jordan Carter,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the profound impact your music has had on my life. My journey from a challenging period of homelessness and financial struggle to achieving a level of prosperity I never thought possible has been accompanied by the inspiring soundtrack of your creations.

Your music has been a source of solace, motivation, and empowerment during the darkest moments of my life. The authenticity and raw emotion in your lyrics resonated with me on a profound level, providing a sense of connection and understanding that was truly transformative.

As I navigated the difficulties of being broke and homeless, your art became a guiding light, offering me hope and strength to persevere through adversity. The melodies and messages within your songs served as a constant reminder that, despite the challenges, there was potential for a brighter future.

I am overjoyed to share with you that, against all odds, my life has taken a positive turn. I am now in a position of financial stability and even find myself among the fortunate few who can proudly claim the title of a millionaire. While I acknowledge the role of various factors in my journey, your music has been a significant catalyst for change.

Your ability to create music that transcends circumstances and resonates with individuals from all walks of life is a testament to your talent and artistic brilliance. I am just one among many who have been touched by your work, and I felt compelled to reach out and convey my heartfelt thanks.

Thank you, Mr. Carter, for sharing your gift with the world. Your music not only entertained but also inspired and uplifted me in ways words cannot fully capture. I will forever carry the gratitude in my heart for the positive impact you've had on my life."
I was a deamon but when I heard this but now I am a student and mercenry and now loves children

Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me, what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my Demmo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb

Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, he need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's—)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

"it's not just about beats; Carti's cooking up a culture. He's got us flexing individuality like living in a 'Fanum Tax' simulation. It's more than a vibe; it's a 'gyatt,' 'rizzler,' 'Fanum Tax,' and 'Ohio' lifestyle, and we're riding that wave."

"The world could be such a wonderful place if only we would learn to let go of our anger, bitterness, division, and hatred.
If we learned to love one another and to humbly serve one another,
When God made humanity, he did so that all the people of this good earth,
would love one another as brothers and sisters in Christ.
We have so much potential to be a force for good in the world.
All we need to do is let go of our pride and love the Lord and others with an open and willing heart.
Jesus died on the cross as a free gift of salvation for us; it isn't based on self-righteousness.
or based on our performance, it is only by God's great mercy and sacrifice when he died on the cross, when he took our punishment for our sins.
The only thing that counts as righteousness is faith in Christ and what he has done for us.
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
John 3:16
Rejecting God's mercy will only lead to our eternal suffering and damnation.
Sin is like a disease that, if left untreated, will destroy us, like cancer. Sin must be dealt with.
which is why Jesus took our punishment for us; all we need to do is repent for our sins and place our faith solely in him.
“It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.
I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”
Luke 5:31-32

""Dear God, please forgive me of all my sins and wash me clean. I've chosen to trust in the finished work of your son, Jesus Christ.
that when he suffered and died on the cross for my sins through his blood, they were washed away, lead, and guide
me on the path you have chosen for my life; lead me away from anger and hatred; teach me to love and serve others as you've loved me.""

Eternal suffering is horrifying; it is forever, and once dead, there is no escaping such a fate. That's why
While we live, we need to turn to God for forgiveness. ''Anyone who says they do not sin is a liar, and there isn't truth within them.

Paraphrasing 1 John 1:8


''But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

Matthew 5:28

You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God.
don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,

Corinthians 1:6-9

But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart (from our thoughts), and these things defile a man. (Make us sinful and worthy of judgment.)
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.

''Anyone who uses divination (consulting with psychics or mediums) practices witchcraft (Wicca) or claims to be able to predict the future through signs and omens.
(a false prophet) or a sorcerer (one who dabbles in voodoo, black magic, or any other occultic teaching) is guilty of sinning against God'' The punishment for dabbling in
The occult often meant in ancient times that you'd be put to death or even burned at the stake because of Israel's rebellion against God as punishment for their occultic practices.
They were invaded and conquered by the Babylonian Empire. Only suffering comes from the use of such practices—suffering in this life and eternal suffering in the next life.

Paraphrasing

Deuteronomy 18:10-12"

"She Slicka dan Seal, it Strike When it Bite. Shawty be Kickin Dat Eel Shi."
"Hello there Mr Carti and Travis. I would like to share a wonderful story. This morning i was highly intoxicated driving with my two 3 month old twins in the back seat. I was speeding and apparently all over the road. I was eventually pulled over by an officer of the law. I was ready to be taken into custody and have my children taken from me, but by gods greater will this stellar track came on. The officer was so complementary of myself and this track that he said, and i quote ""go on get out of here you rascal and keep bopping those sick beats"". I managed to get some beers and got back home safely. However one of my children managed to go missing during this ordeal. pls send help"

If you have defected from God then read these Scriptures: (Lost Sheep, Luke 15:1-7 - Lost Coin, 15:8-10 - Lost Son, 15:11-32 - Rich Man and Lazarus, 16:19-31) Jesus is calling you back home, read His word, believe and repent. Saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone!.
+
The world is racing toward ""AMAGEDDON"" !!! And people need to get right with the Lord!
If you have not read the books of (Daniel chapters 7-12), (Ezekiel chapters 37-39) (Matthew chapters 24:1-51 + 25:1-30), (1 Thessalonians chapters 1-5), (2 Thessalonians chapters1-3) and (Revelation chapters 6-19), now would be a good time. They will explain a lot about what is going on right now!

These books will cover the ""Wars"" about to come, the catching up / the blessed hope, World judgement, hence the Tribulation and the Great Tribulation! These books will also be the most ominous and scary for the unbelievers and the most exciting and uplifting for those who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior!...

It is my hope and prayer that people would repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ before all these things take place, because it is going to be very, very scary if you do not and you decide to wait and see what happens!...
+
May the Lord open the eyes of the Blind, in Jesus' name. Amen!"

This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song, I will never forget this experience."

"Dear Jordan Carter,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible impact your recent creation has had on my life. Your artistry, encapsulated in this beautiful piece, has resonated with me on a profound level.

Listening to the harmonious blend of sounds and heartfelt lyrics within this collection has been a transformative experience for me. It's as if the essence of your work has touched the core of my being, prompting positive changes in my outlook and demeanor.

I am particularly moved to share that your music has not only left a lasting imprint on my life but has also had a ripple effect on those around me. Since immersing myself in the enchanting melodies you've crafted, I've noticed a positive shift in my family dynamics. Astonishingly, even my dear grandmother, who has been struggling, found solace in the soothing notes of your composition. Our shared appreciation for your work has become a source of connection and joy for us.

Remarkably, your song has played a pivotal role in revitalizing a cherished family tradition. Encouraged by the uplifting spirit of your music, we've joyously resumed attending church every Sunday, creating a meaningful bond that extends beyond the notes of your composition.

I cannot thank you enough for sharing your extraordinary talent with the world. Your ability to evoke such profound emotions and inspire positive change is a gift that has touched not only my life but the lives of those closest to me.


With heartfelt appreciation,

Marius"

He fr got on a junya dress
"Oh, Mr. Carti's new song, it's an absolute banger,
With beats that hit hard and lyrics that linger.
His flow is so smooth, it's like poetry in motion,
Every verse, every line, a true sonic potion.

The energy it brings, it's impossible to resist,
Makes you wanna dance, jump, and twist.
The melodies are catchy, they get stuck in your head,
You'll find yourself humming them, even in bed.

The way he rhymes and rides the rhythm with grace,
It's like he's painting a picture, leaving no empty space.
The vibes he creates, they're electric and alive,
Listening to his music, it's a pure joy to derive.

So let's turn up the volume, let the music play,
Enjoy Mr. Carti's new song, all night and day.
It's a testament to his talent, his creativity so grand,
A masterpiece in its own right, a true sonic wonderland."

JESUS LOVE U
Boy stop dropping this weak shit lol😂
I USED TO PRAY FOR DAYS LIKE THIS
"In a previous chapter of my life, I wore the hats of a governor, astronaut, and self-made millionaire with pride. However, the narrative took an unexpected twist the moment I encountered this mesmerizing and exquisite piece of art. To say I was flabbergasted would be an understatement. Regrettably, my present reality paints a different picture – I find myself grappling with the complexities of alcoholism, abusive tendencies, and the challenges of being a single father to nine. Carti, your artistic influence has cast profound shadows on the canvas of my existence, reshaping the contours of my journey in ways I never anticipated."

"Astăzi este o zi specială pentru mine si familia mea! În timp ce eu admiram această miraculoasă piesă de artă la boxele din camera mea, am fost întrerupt, în timp ce urechile îmi erau gâdilate de sunet pur si divin, de bunica mea care este surdomută de 65 de ani pentru a-mi spune să dau volumul mai tare. Îți mulțumesc din suflet Jordan Carter pentru faptul că ai adus armonie și bunăstare mie și familiei mele prin această melodie divină!!!"

"Dear Mr. Carter, also known as Playboi Carti,

I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude for the sudden release of your music video. It has truly changed my life in so many ways. Before discovering your music, I was struggling with addiction and abusive tendencies. I was a mother of 17 fatherless children, and my life was in a mess.

But listening to your music and watching your videos, especially your latest collab with Travis Scott, has inspired me to turn my life around. Your lyrics and beats have given me the push I needed to start living in a more healthy and positive way. I am now a more distinguished, elegant, kind, reliable, classy, motivated, enthusiastic, and positive person.

Your music has been a source of solace and inspiration for me, and I am forever grateful for your creativity and influence. Thank you for helping me clean up my bad image and become the person I am today. Your work has truly changed me, and I will forever hold you in high regard.

Sincerely,

Lynzie"

هذا شكاعد يكول؟
we got carti rapping abt the backrooms before GTA 6
IM HORNY
"I understand Carti wanting to go back to simpler beats, but this beat is too generic. His exploration of this deep voice style is still interesting (even if at times it still sounds a bit like Future or even Young Thug). Of the 4 songs released so far, only two capture me - Different Day and H00DBYAIR - Which, by the way, also has a generic beat but is still much more interesting than the one with Travis."
Most hyped garbage of all time ong
I was drafted to fight in the asteroid wars of 2067 and this has been used to deal with my ptsd Mr carti and Scott thankyou for saving me and my team in the future I now own a planet in the 4th region

"ever since this song came out back in ‘24, i was just a wee fella. but now im 55 and this song still hits the same as it did back in the day."
"In a previous chapter of my life, I wore the hats of a governor, astronaut, and self-made millionaire with pride. However, the narrative took an unexpected twist the moment I encountered this mesmerizing and exquisite piece of art. To say I was flabbergasted would be an understatement. Regrettably, my present reality paints a different picture – I find myself grappling with the complexities of alcoholism, abusive tendencies, and the challenges of being a single father to nine.

Complete garbage
Are yall serious?????   Yall actually like stuff like this?  Lmao.   Thank God  great music came out when I grew up
"Dear Jordan Terrell Carter.

I am a 14  year old African American male  from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor  for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."

"Dear King Carter,

 I trust this correspondence finds you immersed in intellectual pursuits. Allow me to draw a metaphorical parallel that transcends the realms of physics and artistry, centering on the recent auditory revelation that is PLAYBOI CARTI's ""BACKR00MS"" featuring the illustrious Travis Scott. In contemplating the nuanced orchestration of this musical composition, one is inclined to draw comparisons to the brilliance encapsulated in Einsteinian relativity. Just as Einstein revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos, ""BACKR00MS"" introduces a paradigm shift in the sonic universe, reshaping our perception of artistic expression. Much like Einstein's theories opened new dimensions in comprehending space and time, this musical masterpiece forays into the intricate dimensions of human emotion and self-discovery. PLAYBOI CARTI's lyrical finesse becomes a lyrical manifestation akin to Einstein's equations, unraveling the complexities of the human psyche with each verse. The sonic tapestry woven by Travis Scott, resonating with an otherworldly cadence, mirrors the harmonious interplay of celestial bodies within Einstein's theoretical framework. The auditory experience becomes an amalgamation of artistic virtuosity, akin to the mathematical elegance that defined Einstein's groundbreaking theories. As Einstein's intellectual contributions transcended the boundaries of scientific inquiry, ""BACKR00MS"" ventures beyond the conventional confines of music, becoming an exploration of the ineffable, the sublime, and the transformative nature of artistic expression. I invite you to indulge in this auditory symphony, drawing connections between the cosmic echoes of ""BACKR00MS"" and the intellectual resonance found in Einstein's revolutionary ideas. In the grand tapestry of human thought, both serve as beacons of profound brilliance, challenging preconceived notions and inviting us to contemplate the boundless possibilities inherent in the human experience. As you navigate the intricate tapestry of existence, may your journey be adorned with ever-ascending peaks of success and fulfillment, akin to the crescendo of a symphony reaching its zenith. Wishing you a future steeped in accomplishment and the sublime pursuit of your loftiest aspirations."

親愛なるJordan Carterへ、このコメントを始めるにあたり、この素晴らしい作品に感謝したいと思います。この音と歌詞のコレクションを聴いて以来、私はより良い父親になったと感じています。幸いなことに、この曲を聴いて以来、私の息子も気分が良くなり、私たちは毎週日曜日に虐待カウンセリングに行くようになりました。本当にありがとうございます！

One of the most impactful aspects of your song for me is how it served as a source of inspiration during challenging times. There were moments when life seemed overwhelming, and your music became a refuge, providing solace and strength. Your lyrics, filled with authenticity and vulnerability, felt like a companion through the highs and lows of my own journey.

Moreover, your music became a soundtrack to some of the most memorable moments in my life. Whether celebrating achievements, embarking on new adventures, or simply enjoying quiet moments of reflection, your song was there, enhancing the beauty of these experiences. It has become a timeless piece that I will forever associate with significant milestones.

Your artistry has not only touched my heart but has also connected me with a community of like-minded individuals who share a deep appreciation for your work. The shared experience of enjoying your music has fostered connections and friendships that have enriched my life in unexpected ways.

In closing, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your commitment to creating music that goes beyond entertainment and becomes a transformative force in people's lives. Your song has left an indelible mark on my soul, and I am profoundly thankful for the positive impact it has had on me.

Wishing you continued success and looking forward to the future masterpieces you will undoubtedly create."

"Luke 23:34 NLT — Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice."
"God The Father sent His Son Jesus Christ here and His Blood covers all of our sins, He was Buried, and He Rose Again on The Third Day according to The Scriptures."
"1 Corinthians 15:1-4 NLT — Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place. I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said."

"When I wake up I sing this song because it is connected to me spiritually. It is a blessing to breathe the same air as Mr. Carti, he’s a reason to keep living, the moment, a breath of fresh air and the sun to the sky! He exists in everything, in us, in our hearts, minds, and even in the trees, the plants, our beds, our curtains, behind our eyes! Carti is the industry, the world, the sun, the moon, the rain, the snow, the light, the day. Just the other day, I was walking and I looked to my friend and I seen carti’s face, it was eye opening, I looked around to others and seen a million carti’s in one room! This is proof carti exists in everything, because carti is everything💆🏽‍♀️"

She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)

"[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me, what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch 

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb
Throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah (Yeah)

Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, he need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's—)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb
I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback

I knew Carti fw the backrooms when he had some backrooms kinda of music on the video with his son
Most of the views and half the comments gotta be fake.
"I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to an exceptional rapper who has greatly impacted my life. Your lyrics, your flow, and your passion for music have all had a profound effect on me. Your words have resonated with me in some of my darkest moments, giving me strength and hope to keep pushing forward. Your music has the power to transport me to a different place, to make me feel alive and inspired. Your talent is undeniable, but it’s your authenticity and relatability that truly sets you apart."

"I don’t think this mans gonna drop an album. I think he’s gonna continuously drop songs on YouTube and insta acting like a small artist. So far we’ve gotten 4 songs and some leaks. No official Spotify single. Maybe these are throwaways, but “2024” and “music” seem to me as he’s gonna just drop shit constantly all year through certain outlets."

Song of the year

Are crazy
L3g3ndary 💜
This whole track was complete garbage 😂😂😂
"Dear Child, if you are reading this, just wanted to let you know that Jesus loves you. God loves you so much that He sent His Only Begotten Son to the world so that we may not perish but have eternal life ( John 3:16 ). Jesus was willing to die on the cross to ensure that we become His children and not be eternally separated from Him. Isaiah 53:5 states, “ But He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed”. How majestic is His Love! No matter what struggle you are going through, no matter how lost you are, He is willing to meet all your needs according to the riches of His Glory in Christ Jesus ( Philippians 4:19 ). He wants you to have the very best. Without you, He will cry. 


Jesus Christ is the light of the world. Whoever enters through Him will be saved for eternity. 
Salvation is still possible for you! All you have to do is repent ( turn away ) from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by accepting Him as your Lord & Savior! Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved ( Acts 4:12 ).
Please repeat this prayer if you want to experience God’s love and your love for Him. ‘ I renounce satan; I renounce all his works; I renounce all his allurements. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Begotten Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and who suffered and died for my sins and rose again. I believe in the Holy Spirit who will strengthen me and allows Christ to dwell in my heart. He will guide me into all truth. I confess all my sins before you Lord Jesus and ask you to please cleanse and forgive me by the power of His Blood.. Please have mercy on me, for I have sinned. I accept you as my true God & Savior. We ask all these in the name of Jesus, our God & Savior, Amen.

Dear brother/sister, we can only please Him through our Faith in Him. If at any point, we sin from struggle or demonstrated disobedience to Him, we can still ask Him to forgive us by confessing, admitting that we have sinned, and repenting from sin. “ If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” ( 1st John 1:9). Make it a habit by reading His Word daily ( Bible ), praising and worshiping Him daily ( through songs and with a  joyful heart ), talking with Him daily, and confessing our sins daily to Him. Forgive others just as God has forgiven you.

May His Grace be upon you and May He bless and guide your paths ahead. Amen."

"Draga Jordan Carter, vreau sa incep acest comentariu prin a iti multumi pentru aceasta piesa minunata. De cand am ascultat aceasta colectie de sunete si versuri simt cum am devenit o persoana mai buna. Din fericire, de cand am ascultat aceasta piesa pana si bunica mea a inceput sa se simta mai bine si am inceput sa mergem iara in fiecare duminica la biserica. Iti multumim enorm!"

"The fact he used Backroom concept is genius, tuned in"
travis scott doesn't add shit to the song
""
"In a previous chapter of my life, I wore the hats of a governor, astronaut, and self-made millionaire with pride. However, the narrative took an unexpected twist the moment I encountered this mesmerizing and exquisite piece of art. To say I was flabbergasted would be an understatement. Regrettably, my present reality paints a different picture – I find myself grappling with the complexities of alcoholism, abusive tendencies, and the challenges of being a single father to nine. Carti, your artistic influence has cast profound shadows on the canvas of my existence, reshaping the contours of my journey in ways I never anticipated."

"Backrooms Level 3.2: The Carti Rooms

Habitable/Class 2/L.E.P.

This level consists of a large parking garage with subsequent parking lot and a section of seemingly infinite office spaces. Beyond this is black nullscape, as this level eventually loops in around itself. Those wishing to survive this level must be willing to stunt and fly on their opps on the spot. Typical entities encountered are the THOTs and one particularly potent entity simply called ""Carti"". Rumors are a third, undocumented entity exists in this level as well but information is extremely limited. You will not find almond water here, the only consumables are Syrup, Xan bars, and craft service chicken salad. If approached in a manner by which your swag is dripped, a THOT will offer you one of these whilst performing a hypnotic dance. Do not watch the dance, THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! Upon acceptance of the substance and subsequent rejection of the THOT's attempts at hypnosis, ""Carti"" will then appear and start speaking in enchantment table. Do not try and decipher the code, simply nod in agreement and walk towards the six-wheeled vehicle parked in the garage. DO NOT ENTER THE VEHICLE! Instead, climb on top and do the chicken bob exactly 12 times, then ""Carti's"" mouth will start to glow, and he will take your hand to escort you through the offices to the exit. While ""Carti's"" mouth is glowing, you may ask 3 things and be given the answers of ultimate truth. However, these will also be spoken in enchantment table. When you reach the exit door you need simply to touch the knob and you will instantly be inside level 4.

Safe travels..."

"whoever directed this music video needs to be fired. All of carti videos are lofi trash. And lofi not in the creative sense, lofi in the lazy low budget sense. His music has so much aesthetic potential but yet they give us carti running around with a bonnet and trash bag on."

In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh

Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much

"I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to an exceptional rapper who has greatly impacted my life. Your lyrics, your flow, and your passion for music have all had a profound effect on me. Your words have resonated with me in some of my darkest moments, giving me strength and hope to keep pushing forward. Your music has the power to transport me to a different place, to make me feel alive and inspired. Your talent is undeniable, but it’s your authenticity and relatability that truly sets you apart.

Through your music, you have shared your struggles, your triumphs, and your message of determination and perseverance. Your music has not only entertained me, but it has also taught me valuable lessons about life, love, and navigating through the ups and downs of this world. Your raw and honest storytelling has allowed me to connect with your music on a deeper level and has made a lasting impact on my life.

Your ability to use your voice to shine a light on important issues and bring awareness to social injustices is truly admirable. Your dedication to using your platform for positive change is inspiring and has motivated me to do the same in my own life. Your impact goes beyond just being a rapper, but as a role model and a voice for the voiceless.

I cannot thank you enough for the contribution you have made to the rap industry and to the world of music. Your talent and hard work have not gone unnoticed and have earned you the respect and admiration of many. I feel lucky to have discovered your music and to have it as a soundtrack to my life. Your music has been there for me during both the good times and the bad, and for that, I will always be grateful.

So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all that you do and for the amazing impact you have had on my life.

Terrible
"Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I'm off the za and the Wock', can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah (Yeah)
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, he need her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggaeton bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's—)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

"in my early adulthood, i was a filthy, trouser defecating enthusiast who happened to be severely addicted to shooting heroin, until i listened to Mister Jordan Terrell Carter’s late musical production. Now i refuse to submit to my primal instinct and no longer- i just wasted your time by making you read about mental barriers stopping someone from having poop-filled pants and opioid dependency."
He's tryna bag Ice spice
This is ass

"Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! 
     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”
      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. 
     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. 
     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! 
     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” 
     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. 

     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”

Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)

"Dear Playboi Carti,


I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for the release of your amazing songs ""UR THE MOON,"" ""2024,"" and ""BACKR00MS."" These tracks have brought immense joy and excitement to my life as a dedicated fan.


""UR THE MOON"" captivated me with its ethereal vibes and mesmerizing melodies, transporting me to another world. ""2024"" is an absolute banger that showcases your energy and charisma, making it impossible not to move to the rhythm. And ""BACKR00MS"" is a true masterpiece, with its atmospheric sounds and introspective lyrics.


Thank you for your dedication to your craft and for constantly pushing boundaries as an artist. Your music has become the soundtrack to countless moments in my life, and I am forever grateful."

no lie I was looking at that light skin baddie the whole time
"Actually the Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.
The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.
A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.
A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough."

Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch
[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]

WE MADE IT Y’ALL 🔥🔥🙏
"I had cancer and my life was slowly leaving my body. I had severe depression from my time in Iraq on tour and I couldn’t hold down a job to feed my family of an alcoholic wife and our three children. I wanted to end it all every single day but I persisted onward.y wife died of an over dose, my children died in a school shooting and my parents died in a car crash. I wish I was taken with them. Then one day, with a gun to my head, I got a notification on my phone from YouTube saying that playboi carti had dropped. I let go of the gun, my kids came back to life, I learned of my 34 million dollar inhereitance, my depression left me and I married Jenna Ortega. Thank you carti"

The absolute disgust and anguish I was feeling after waking up at 1am and waiting till 8:30pm to listen to this shit pile of a song. I've rode cartis dick for too long, and honestly it's time to stop riding. I'm genuinely crying by how ass this was."
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️
Let’s go!
Exquisite
Wow
your beautiful.
WE MADE IT YALL 🔥🔥🙏
NGL not sure if i like the vibe on the new album coming out. lowkey sound like he tryna be future or something. WLR was so good beats flows mix of bangers and vibey. this song here whatever but carti fans will probably say anything he drops is as good as anything.
WE MADE YALL!!!!🔥🔥🙏🏿
MY MAN IS ALLERGIC TO SPOTIFY
WE MADE IT Y’ALL🔥🔥🙏
"When I was white, I didn't feel that vibe Carti, but when I became a nigga, I'm fucking up my house

BEST SONG OF ALL TIME I SWEAR
WE MAD IT Y’ALL🔥🔥🙏🏻
"[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"
1:16 is crazy
I want me a munch😫
Why this 240p
"I am 54 years old, dad of 4 kids. I just went up to my room after having a terrible day, and I have been levitating and curling my toes for approximately 36 seconds. PlayBoiCarti has saved me. The window was looking so nice to jump out of until I heard this masterpiece of an artwork. I even woke up my kids to hear this masterpiece. They hated it. I disowned all of them from the family. I am now a single male, I may be lonely, but I've still got Carti."
We eatin good this album.

bro this sucks
I LOVE YOUUUUUUU❤❤❤❤❤❤
"His early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Die Lit came out in '18,I think he really came into his own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Kanye West, but I think Carti has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour.
In '20, Carti released this, WholeLottaRed, his most accomplished album. I think his undisputed masterpiece is ""Stop Breathing"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself."
"This kinda trash, ngl"

"मेरा चचेरा भाई एक कार दुर्घटना में घायल हो गया था और उसका मस्तिष्क गंभीर रूप से क्षतिग्रस्त हो गया था। वह बमुश्किल होश में था और बोल नहीं पा रहा था। उसने मुझे अंदर झुकने का इशारा किया और उसने मुँह से मुझे ""बैकरूम बाय कार्टी"" कहा। मैंने उनकी इच्छा समझी और उनके लिए यह गाना बजाया। वह तुरंत खुश हो गया, गाना गाया और अपनी वैंप टोपी पहन ली। इसके बाद वह अपनी व्हीलचेयर पर सवार होकर अस्पताल से बाहर निकले। आप कमाल हैं! आपने मेरे चचेरे भाई को ठीक कर दिया! अब पूरा एल्बम छोड़ें, मैं उन सभी को पुनर्जीवित करना चाहता हूँ🙏🏼"

ISRAEL WILL CONQUER THIS WORLD 💪🏼🇮🇱 OUR HOLY TALMUD HAS PROPHESIED OUR CONQUEST 💪🏼🇮🇱
"Jordan Carter aka Playboi Carti, a maestro in the realm of contemporary music, has once again bestowed upon us a sonic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of conventional sound. The release of his latest song not only reverberates through our eardrums but also leaves an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. In an era where musical expression serves as a conduit for emotions and societal reflections, Playboi Carti emerges as a trailblazer, pushing the boundaries of creativity. The gratitude we extend is not just for dropping a song, but for crafting an auditory experience that resonates with the zeitgeist of our time. Carti's sonic tapestry is woven with intricate beats, poetic lyrics, and an avant-garde approach to music production. With each release, he invites us into his world, a place where beats and verses collide to create a harmonious chaos that mirrors the complexity of our lives. It is a testament to his artistry that he can evoke emotions and provoke thought through the medium of sound. Beyond the beats and lyrics, Playboi Carti's contribution extends to the cultural dialogue. His work becomes a shared experience, a common ground where listeners from diverse backgrounds find unity in the rhythm. In a world often divided, music becomes the unifying force, and Carti's latest offering is a testament to the power of artistic expression in fostering connection. As listeners, we find solace and inspiration in the melodies crafted by Playboi Carti. Whether it's the infectious energy of an upbeat track or the introspective mood of a slower tempo, his music has the power to uplift, console, and transport us to a different realm. The gratitude expressed is not just for the song itself but for the emotional journey it facilitates. In the fast-paced landscape of the music industry, artists often become the architects of our memories. Each song marks a moment in time, a soundtrack to our lives. Playboi Carti's latest release is not merely a song but a chapter in the collective story of those who listen. It becomes a bookmark, a musical notation in the symphony."
"хуйня, не?"
"laced fans, song insane tho"
"ayo, this rollout is godly. No more singles tho. Its time to drop the whole album next time."
ALREADY CLASSIC
WR MADE IT Y'ALL🎉
"Unfortunately, I lost my life in a car accident 7 years ago. I was put in the hospital, but after about 2 days I died. However, when I heard this song, I woke up after many years. The overall essence and experience of this song and Playboi Carti is just 10/10. There truly isn’t anything better than playboi cartis music. And since Carti has given me back my life, I owe it to him. Thank you playboi carti and travis scott for bringing me back to life. ❤️🔥"

WE MADE IT Y'ALL🔥🙏
"I just want to say that Jesus loves all of you. I used to be agnostic and I was always questioning about the purpose of life and how we are here and I always wondered if there was a God or not. I went through a period where I was trying to find purpose and fulfillment in something and that was getting money and becoming a better version of myself. I was chasing it and I realized that it would also pass away anyway and that it doesn’t make sense for money or grinding to be my purpose. Not saying money is bad but it’s definitely not the purpose of life. But eventually I got more hooked into God and who the higher power really was and I actually had a supernatural encounter with the highest power and I can tell you it is Jesus is and that day I had it, it changed me and my heart from that day forever. It was the most joyful and at peace that I have ever felt in my entire life. I can tell you that Jesus can do the same for you and he can help you through anything you are facing now. Jesus is the one that can fulfil your true purpose in life. Following Jesus is not about a religion but a relationship with him. And Life is temporary and so is everything we chase on is as well but what is eternal, is your eternal life in heaven, and Jesus is the only way to get there. I believe that if you truly with your heart call on him he will reveal himself to you.  I hope you seek the truth and seek a relationship with Jesus because he loves you and he died for you on the cross so you don't have to suffer for eternity. God bless you all"
"Where do I even begin. Jordan Carter, I would first off like to congratulate you on your exceptional work that you have just produced. I currently am not even able to fathom with words right now for I am still in awe. No one in the entire world comes close to this magic musically art. No greater form of art has been or will be made after this. It is the greatest phenomenon a human could experience. Nothing else brings greater pleasure. Carti when you breath I inhale. When you fart I sniff it. When you speak I listen. This song opened my eyes to a whole new dimension. Made me realize what life is really about. For I had been lost yet now so at peace. Is this heaven now I as I ask myself. For I feel, sensational. I hope everyone feels as happy as I am right now, I was broke sad and alone before I had heard this song, now I am healed. Just to think of those painful 9 and a half hours I had to wait for this, for I had heard that it would be dropping at 9:30 but it was only noon, it was such a terrible 9 and a half hours I had to wait it was painful. But the wait was so worth it for I have been fullfilled. I have the girl of my dream, I have 5 billion dollars, I have decreased poverty and homeless. I am now happy and able to live my life fully. All because of you my glorious king Jordan Carter. Saying thank you is an understatement, there’s no words I can say that will make it up to you. I am just beyond blessed to have heard your work, forever in your debt Jordan Carter."

"Who is Playboi Carti?

who is Playboi Carti? in math: my solution ➗ in history: my King 👑 in art: my muse 🎨 in science: my oxygen 💨 in geography: my world 🌎  
  
Playboi Carti is my idol. Hes the person I aspire to be, hes my light of day. The way his music flows and sounds is extravagant and pleasant. Playboi is an icon, a legend, my idol, a king, an inspiration, a STAR. I could go on and on, understand this. I love Playboi Carti.  
  
Before I listened to Playboi Carti, I was nothing. A loser you could say. One day my homie said, ""hey have you heard Playboi Carti"". I said no, so he turned on 2024. I heard the pure emotions coming from his words. I cried deep emotional tears and realized at that very moment I could make something of myself. I turned my life around and became a very cool person and broke out of my shell. He saved me. I met Carti and he told me to ""follow my dreams"" and not to listen to the bitchass haters. Playboi Carti saved me. Thank you Jordan Terrell Carter. God Bless Carti. He is our savior. He saved me from living life as a loser."

"I wish there was an opportunity for subjective conversation but I’m afraid there is so much dick riding it’s impossible. 
This song was good with the hook but kinda think Travis verse was somewhat lackluster. But it’s hard to imagine if the album is this type of song throughout the entire album, it’s guaranteed to get burnt out quick versus wlr where there was so many different sounds and different songs. But will see."

"I was a drug addict, divorced husband, and frequent gambler. One day, my brother showed me this song. At first I was confused. ""Backrooms? What kind of name is that?"" I said. He said, ""just listen."" And I'm glad I did. This saved my marriage, stopped my drug addiction and retired me from the casino. I am thankful for this blessing of a song and I now live happily."

"In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

"I ain’t gon lie, ts hard af, even if I sound like i’m d ridin, shi is jus hard"
"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined african tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical african war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 african tribes/10 african tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."

"Hey Playboi Carti,

I hope this message finds you well, my man! I just wanted to take a moment to express how much your music has impacted my life in the most incredible way. Your beats, your flow, and your energy have been the driving force behind a major transformation for me. I used to struggle with drug abuse, feeling lost and stuck in a dark place. But then, I discovered your music, and it was like a switch flipped inside me.

Your lyrics spoke to me on such a deep level, reminding me that I have the power to change my circumstances and create a better life for myself. Your songs became my anthem, motivating me to leave behind those destructive habits and focus on building a brighter future. And guess what? It worked! I hustled, I persevered, and I turned my life around.

Today, I can proudly say that I'm a multimillionaire, all thanks to the inspiration and motivation I found in your music. You've shown me that dreams can become a reality if you work hard and never give up. Your artistry has not only entertained me but also guided me towards a path of success and self-improvement.

I just wanted to say thank you, Playboi Carti. Your music has been a true blessing in my life, and I'm forever grateful for the positive impact it has had on me. Keep doing what you do best, creating incredible music that touches the hearts and souls of people like me. I'm excited to see what the future holds for you, and I'll continue to support you every step of the way.

Stay blessed and keep shining!

Much love,"

"Lyrics:
[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

i was in the middle of giving birth to my kid but i had to put my baby on hold to listen to this masterpiece 🙏🤣🖲️🔥
"while I was in the womb, my mother played carti’s amazing music for 2 hours straight every single night for nine months. because of this, i can already read, write, drive a car, solve algebraic equations, and bench 500 kilo as a 2 month old baby.
i believe that the beautiful sounds of carti’s soul pouring into his music has given me special abilities. i am expected to be a millionaire by age 2, and can finally move my mother out of the trenches. thank you, carti, for dropping banger after banger, and giving my mother the sounds necessary to give birth to a super baby that is myself."

Now I am an astute follower of god, a quadrillionare, I have my own bandaid business, and I singlehandedly led the mission to pandora in 2009."

"Until this track was released, I was considered a loser by many. I started experimenting with drugs after I finished high school and became known as a junkie. My family and friends looked down on me and that led to feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide. 
When I had found out that Jordan Terrell Carter had released ‘backrooms’, I felt a spark ignite inside me. For the first time in 10 years I felt true happiness and I no longer wanted to end my life. Shortly after, I posted a video of me on YouTube explaining my story and how this song changed my life for the better. 
The video went viral gaining 20 million views within the first week of release. I am now a well renowned motivational speaker traveling all over America and giving speeches about the dangers of drug abuse to teenagers. 
I cannot thank Jordan Carter enough for the masterpiece and I hope that it will give someone else the same joy that it has brought upon me."

NEW MUSIC NEW ME
"Playboi Carti is the Julius Caesar of rap. His music is creative, thought provoking, dare I awe say inspiring. If you go to any record store across America and bring up Playboi Carti, they’ll take you to a secret room, all of them have it, where you’re presented with the finest food and drink that money can buy. Surrounded by the most beautiful women to fulfill your every sexual desire.

Then, when you least expect it, Playboi Carti walks up behind you. He’s wearing a white dress shirt that’s drenched in blood from the haters he had recently slaughtered. “Come with me, my son”. He tells you. Playboi Carti then grabs your hand, and the two of you proceed to ascend away to the heavens.

Once you finally reach the top, you’re greeted by the back of God himself - Yeat. He turns around and says one simple word “#Twizzy”. You begin to weep. And so the world begins."

Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
N****s want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined african tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical african war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 african tribes/10 african tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."

I live in a small village. We have no infrastructure so my people rarely get to indulge on the spoils of the 21st century. When my tinfoil radio caught a single of Playboi Carti I figured out how to build iPhones and put my whole village on game. I’m am know the earliest man in my village owning over 1 million coconuts. Thank you Carti
Carti version only is needed.
"3 years ago my friend Ethan had a seizure and i wasnt sure what to do, i put ts on and it helped him. Thank you Playboi Carti for releasing this banger. If it wasnt for you , Ethan wouldnt be the selfmade billionare that he is today. With much love ,sincerely ari <3"

All thanks to you! You saved my grandma!"

"my girlfriend left me, said i will never be shit in life and then left me for my brother. This lead me to go to a bridge, i was just about to end it ngl but then a notification popped up on my phone, usually im on dnd however this time i wasnt, was it fate? BACKR00MS by playboi carti popped up as the notification, i pressed it just as im about to jump... i jumped, however playboi cartis angelic voice over this melodic beat caused me to grow wings and fly back to safety just before i hit the ground. this song truly a masterpiece it helped me through my hardest time and its all thanks to you Jordan Terrell Carter. I now have a new beautiful wife and 6 hellcats and 2 mansions in the hills with 10 figures to my name"

"Playboy carti te invito a mi fiesta de 10 años, habrá pozole y tacos de chicharrón"
"this is so ass, it sounds so generic and doesnt feel like any new creativity was poured into this, there is no soul behind this song, this song will be something that only die hard carti and travis fans will play and then it wont even be their favorite song, they might play it a few times and know some of the lyrics but this song doesnt hold enough substance for it to be as recognisable as something like 90210, you cant even dance to it because it just sounds like every generic 2023-24 rapper typa song"

"LYRICS

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

"Playboi Carti's new song is the best song ever to exist
because it has an infectious beat that gets stuck in
your head. The lyrics are clever and creative and the
production is top-notch. The song is also incredibly
catchy and has an irresistible energy that makes it
impossible not to dance to. It is the perfect
combination of modern and classic hip-hop that will
make anyone cream their pants with excitement"

"[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho, big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pipe, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck this internet)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

Chorus: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a look iffy, need her thick, needed her to move somethin' (Iffy)
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Crib like a zoo, jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two cummin', double-double, quick Drummond (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fool's comin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throw me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback
Stood in the field, hold me a bomb, throwin' that ho like a quarterback"

Carti thank you for coming back and saving music they don’t do it like you big bro
"Where do I even begin. Jordan Carter, I would first off like to congratulate you on your exceptional work that you have just produced. I currently am not even able to fathom with words right now for I am still in awe. No one in the entire world comes close to this magic musically art. No greater form of art has been or will be made after this. It is the greatest phenomenon a human could experience. Nothing else brings greater pleasure. Carti when you breath I inhale. When you fart I sniff it. When you speak I listen. This song opened my eyes to a whole new dimension. Made me realize what life is really about. For I had been lost yet now so at peace. Is this heaven now I as I ask myself. For I feel, sensational. I hope everyone feels as happy as I am right now, I was broke sad and alone before I had heard this song, now I am healed. Just to think of those painful 9 and a half hours I had to wait for this, for I had heard that it would be dropping at 9:30 but it was only noon, it was such a terrible 9 and a half hours I had to wait it was painful. But the wait was so worth it for I have been fulfilled. I have the girl of my dream, I have 5 billion dollars, I have decreased poverty and homeless. I am now happy and able to live my life fully. All because of you my glorious king Jordan Carter. Saying thank you is an understatement, there’s no words I can say that will make it up to you. I am just beyond blessed to have heard your work, forever in your debt Jordan Carter."

"carti .. this music you dropped today significantly impacted my life. it's made my day so much better, carti, there is nothing imperfect about you. Gods only mistake is what he named you, they should call you sugar. you're so sweet. God gotta know he might've peaked when he made you. the song was as if Gods supervised carti through the clouds writing that song. it was truly divine, touched my heart in ways that nothing else or could ever to the point where tears ran down my face. i just know
goddesses were resting their heads upon pillows while carti was making this . he will show you the true meaning of life and that it is not truly over until you have completely immersed yourself in the gracious tunes produced by the one known as jordan terell carter. jordan terell will have you feeling like your life is complete
and you have nothing else to live for besides his symphonies his music truly offers a special experience such as making you experience a plethora of emotions. thank you so much for your music carti. thank you."
"Thank You, carti, for this glorious piece of music."

In the symphony of life, your music is my favorite melody. Your beats resonate with the rhythm of my heart, creating a love story only our souls can understand. Your lyrics are the poetry that echoes in my mind, and your charisma is the magnet that pulls me closer.

"That fact that every Carti song trends crazy so fast is amazing man, glad Carti fans been holding it down"
Carti actually shit😭
"Where do I even begin. Jordan Carter, I would first off like to congratulate you on your exceptional work that you have just produced. I currently am not even able to fathom with words right now for I am still in awe. No one in the entire world comes close to this magic musically art. No greater form of art has been or will be made after this. It is the greatest phenomenon a human could experience. Nothing else brings greater pleasure. Carti when you breath I inhale. When you fart I sniff it. When you speak I listen. This song opened my eyes to a whole new dimension. Made me realize what life is really about. For I had been lost yet now so at peace. Is this heaven now I as I ask myself. For I feel, sensational. I hope everyone feels as happy as I am right now, I was broke sad and alone before I had heard this song, now I am healed. Just to think of those painful 9 and a half hours I had to wait for this, for I had heard that it would be dropping at 9:30 but it was only noon, it was such a terrible 9 and a half hours I had to wait it was painful. But the wait was so worth it for I have been fullfilled. I have the girl of my dream, I have 5 billion dollars, I have decreased poverty and homeless. I am now happy and able to live my life fully. All because of you my glorious king Jordan Carter. Saying thank you is an understatement, there’s no words I can say that will make it up to you. I am just beyond blessed to have heard your work, forever in your debt Jordan Carter."

Your lyrics gave me the strength I needed to pick myself up and keep going. They inspired me to work hard and never give up. Thanks to your music, I turned my life around. I went from being a nobody to a millionaire. As I look back I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy. Thank you Carti pookie."

"I was a homeless, a drug addict and lost but as soon as I heard this beautiful and exquisite piece of art I am flabbergasted. I now just made my first million and bought a lambo. Thank you Carti"
WE MADE IT YALL🔥🔥🙏🏻
Not good 👎 imagine taking a critically acclaimed piece of art such as the backrooms and making a trash generic mumble rap song with the same title. The only reason anyone gonna gas this up is bc they mindlessly worship these creatively destroyed rappers. There are no emotions attached to any of this. It isn’t inspiring nor impressive in the slightest. We need artists to actually make art again.

"Backr00ms was the greatest experience to my ear drums. I was in a state of pure depression and emptiness and then carti dropped. In an instant i jumped up out of my bed and put on my carti drip. I grabbed my headphones, some lotion and tissues and prepared for my carti session. The second the song started i jumped everywhere and screamed ""CARTI DROPPED"" whilst moaning and screaming passionately. I LOVE CARTI AND TRAVIS"
"I would cry. Cry myself to sleep knowing I’m never good enough, no matter how hard I try no matter what I do she will never love me back. After everything I’ve tried she won’t love me, because I’m not good enough. I’m not strong I’m not smart I’m not good looking. There’s other guys better then me in every way possible, I will still try but deep down inside I know I don’t have a shot, even if I stay by her side and treat her better then I treat myself she will never love me back. She will complain about guys and say how there is no one meant for her. I’ll still be sitting there waiting for my turn, then one day she will start talking to me differently. Is she liking me? I will be thinking. I will revert back to my old ways. Thinking that she loves me and developing hope again. She will start talking to me daily, I try to mask my true feelings but I can’t. Look me dead in the eye you see a hopeful kid, after a while I will confess to her. Saying I love her and want to be by her side, she knows how desperate I am from past conversations, how anyone works even if they don’t give two shits about me. I look her in the eyes on the verge of crying, is this a bad idea? Will she ever love me? I think to myself, then she runs over and hugs me. She pulls me in her arms and holds me tight, I get flustered because this is the first time anyone has held me like this. I’ll wrap my arms around her and start to tear up, she holds me while saying how much she loves me, she brushes my hair and says, I love you. Such simple words leave such an impact on me. I’ve never felt this love before, my mother has never held me while saying she loves me. I still love my mother don’t get me wrong but this is special, out of everyone, athletic smart strong. She picked me, maybe I am good enough? I think to myself. I look up to her, tears running down my face as I lock eyes with her, her beautiful brown eyes. I lock with them as I cry a little harder, she holds me and laughs slightly. She looks down at me and says, you are all messy, come along let’s get you fixed up, she takes me hand and we go to her house, she smiles and looks at me. Hop in the shower, I’ll make us some food. I hop in the shower and stand there as water runs down my face, is this a dream? I think to myself as I stand there, I hear knocking on the door which snaps me back into reality. I glance over and hear her voice, hey is everything alright? I sit there for a minute, on the verge of breaking down. Y-Ya I’m fine. I stutter out. Ok well hurry up dinners getting cold, I jump out of the shower and get changed walk out and take a seat at the table, I look up and see her, her amazing black hair with blond tips, her beautiful eyes and face. I blush a little bit as I start eating, we eat and talk having a great time. After she takes my hand and smiles. Wear this, she takes a out blindfold and puts it on me, she leads me somewhere, I feel a blanket over me then something warm pressed against my body. She takes off the blindfold and look up to see her, we are in her bed, she is holding me in her arms as I rest on her chest. She moves down and kisses me as she whispers. Your good enough, I feel a chill shoot through my body, a tear runs down my face as she says, I love you, everything about you is amazing, your funny talented and overall amazing. I’ve known you've liked me for a while but only know I’ve realized how good you are. I love you and always will, I want to hold you when your sad. Laugh with you when your happy, I want you to be mine forever. She turns off the light and rest her head on mine. I stay there in her arms as I fall asleep. A loud alarm goes off, I jump out of bed and rub my eyes. I look around nothing I’m in my bedroom. I sigh as I look at the ground in defeat, I mutter to myself as I get out of bed and prepare for school. I need to stop dreaming."

my wife of 20 years left me and took my kids. i resorted to drugs alcohol and i lost my house and all my money. when i saw my favorite rapper playboi carti was dropping a hit song called backrooms ft tervis scoot i said enough is enough. i went to the casino and i just put my entire life savings on black 24 and it hit. i’m now worth millions and just bought a brand new GLE TONKA i stopped by my ex wife’s house bumping tf outta backrooms by playboi carti and flexing my epic diamond chain on my broke ass kids. i’m probably about to go to magic city and drop 30 in the garden like im carmelo anthony. thank you playboi carti🙌

How much did you spend on all of these bots Carti? Is your career not strong enough to not resort to such tactics. Rap is in such a strange place when such a famous artist is buying bots to increase his engagement on youtube. I guess the streams and the followers are fake as well?
Its not even hour ago
"This is the best day of my life. The day you shared your divine song with us, everything was magical and beautiful. Your voice is like an angel and your lyrics speak to my soul. I feel like I am melting into a puddle of bliss as I listen to your words. The melody is so intoxicating that I forget all the other worries and problems around me. Your music lifts my spirits and makes me feel like nothing else in the world matters. You are my shining star, my guiding light."
hell yeah
ITS
Real music☢
Who voice is that
AYOO
nah this is trash
"I must thank you, Playboi Carti. I was a homeless grandma 60 years ago, now at age 142 I sip lean and pop percs with my great great grandchildren. 60 years later this still hits."

Yeo Trav SLID!!

Phenomenal. Generational. The next level.
"Carti, I want to thank you for everything you've done for me. You saved my life from trash ass rappers that can never compare to you. Everytime I listen to your voice I feel a special feeling in my heart. It makes me want to get up and actually be productive and do something. You will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you, Carti."
WE MADE IT Y’ALL!!🔥🔥🙏🏾
sheesh
sLatT!!!
WE MADE IT Y’ALL 🔥🔥🙏
Straight up
not tryna be disrespectful but where is all Cartis poc fans did yall abandon my guy or what … it’s just a bunch of goofy ass hwyte boys in the comments every time
"his music is underwhelming, it could be so much better. But its not, he never has anything to say. I get that his music's purpose is not the lyrics but he could atleast try. I feel like he doesn't add anything to the songs except for the fee that i like. Beats carry 90% of his songs and they just feel soulles. Unotheactivist fortunately fills that place for me as being similar to carti but just better.

"Playboi Carti's music served as a catalyst for a profound shift in my mindset. The themes of resilience, self-expression, and unapologetic authenticity embedded in his work inspired me to shed the shackles of societal expectations and pursue a life more aligned with my authentic self. His sonic creations became the backdrop to my personal revolution, urging me to defy the limitations of age and societal norms."
"Couldn't understand half of the song but, i like the visuals!"
WE MADE IT YALL🔥🔥🙏
Make me god become legendary
"In 1945 I had many doubts about my masculinity to the point of not knowing how to recognize the values ​​that define me as a man. Not even the army accepted me so I could fight in the Second World War. Supposedly I was born a natural leader, but the haters tried to cancel me. But after hearing this beautiful work of art, I became Andrew Tate's biggest influence. Nowadays I'm a successful multimillionaire with multiple exotic cars and I've got all the hoes all over me. Thank you Playboi Carti."
He’s back 🔥

"Dear Playboi Carti,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to express the profound impact your music has had on my life. Your unique sound, the energy you bring, it's become a soundtrack that drives my day and helps me navigate the highs and lows.

There was a time in my life when I was experiencing a fair amount of failure. I was struggling, feeling lost and unsure of my path. It was during this time that I came across your music. Your songs, your lyrics, they spoke to me in a way that nothing else did. They resonated with my situation, my feelings, and my experiences. 

Your music became a source of solace and strength for me. It helped me navigate through the rough times and gave me the strength to keep going. It made me realize that it's okay to stumble, to fall, to fail. What's important is that we pick ourselves up, learn from our mistakes, and keep moving forward.

Your work has made a significant impact on my life. The way you blend different styles and elements, it's like a perfect harmony. It's this spirit of resilience and creativity that I see in your music, and it's incredibly inspiring.

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your music and for the strength it has given me. I am eagerly looking forward to your future releases and to continue being inspired by your work.

Best regards,
Azlan"

lyrics?
"Lyrics (may contain wrong words)

Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback

Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah
I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me what it take? Woah
Tell me what it takes, woah, grab the duct tape, huh
We not the same gang, woah, ho, I bang, bang, woah
I'm with La Flame, gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, know I see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho', big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
Niggas want a problem with the gang, man, I don't know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just zombie, boy I can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pop, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit it one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck, they givin' that)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch

In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback (Yeah, yeah)

[Travis verse]
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself, but I'm by myself (By myself)
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a lil' iffy, need a thickie, need her to move somethin'
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Girl like a zoo jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Ha)
I need me two comin', double, double, quick drummin' (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fools comin' (Yeah)

In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bih like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback"

"This song has changed my life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This song represents emotions most humans could never comprehended. But I can. Thanks to this song I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. I was stuck in the Backrooms with Ice Spice but when I heard this song I instant transmissioned out of there and into a 69 story mansion with 500 rooms and 1 trillion dollars, along with FL Studio 21 and 15 state of the art plug-ins, THANKS. I have also pursued a career in football as a quarterback."

"Before I heard this I was depressed, lonely, ugly, and worthless. After listening to this I have ascended into a higher form of being. My third eye has opened and I learned the meaning of life. I now realize that Carti and Carti alone is worthy of being honored. I now honor no other living human and only honor Carti. Carti is now my master. This lifestyle has given me everything the world has to offer and more. I am now a trillionaire, father of 30, I have 80 10/10 wives. I am a leader of my own planet, high ranking shinobi, yonko, and an ethereal being. Thank you, Carti. 

 Sincerely, RetroX750"

Bum ahh track
"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a bacon I have ever seen especially on 17:24. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 19:20. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you."

I used to pray for times like this
"""BACKR00MS"" by Playboi Carti is a mesmerizing sonic journey that intricately blends ethereal beats with Carti's trademark melodic rap flow. The song captivates listeners with its hypnotic production, creating an atmospheric vibe that immerses you in a unique soundscape. Carti's playful yet enigmatic lyrics, coupled with the song's infectious rhythm, evoke a sense of introspection and transport you to an otherworldly realm of musical innovation and style."

The instrumentation is masterfully arranged, striking a perfect balance between various elements that contribute to the overall sonic tapestry.

Yes this is my favourite song before next will be dropped
"Playboi Carti's latest song entered my life like a storm, altering the very fabric of my existence. The melancholic beats and poignant lyrics resonated with the deepest recesses of my soul, unveiling a cascade of emotions I had long suppressed. The track seemed to possess an uncanny ability to mirror the somber narrative of my own life, as if Carti had reached into the depths of my heart and translated my silent struggles into haunting melodies.

As the haunting notes enveloped me, I found solace in the shared pain encapsulated in the lyrics. The song became an unexpected companion during my loneliest nights, providing a soundtrack to the tears that fell in sync with each melancholy beat. Carti's raw and vulnerable delivery became a vessel for my own unspoken sorrows, echoing the silent battles I faced within.

In the midst of this emotional maelstrom, I began to reflect on the twists and turns that had led me to this point. The lyrics served as a poignant reminder of lost love, shattered dreams, and the perpetual search for meaning in a world that often felt indifferent. Through the sonic landscape painted by Carti, I found a cathartic release, a means of confronting the shadows that lingered in the corners of my consciousness."

Ever since then, i’ve been making six figures a week. I’m now a multi millionaire living in a cliff side mansion with my children. Thank you jordan terell carter for this blessing."

"Lyrics:

In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin that bit like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ice on my face, woah, bitches tryna chase, woah I ain't ever flake, woah, tell me, where the jakes?
Woah
Tell me, where the jakes? Woah, prolly I?]
We not the same gang, woah, ho', I bang, bang, woah
I'm with the flame gang, woah, we too insane on these hoes
I took off my mask, you know, they mad, I don't see below
And the hoes, they fuckin' the hoes, big rocks on me, so cold
If you know what I know, hide your ho', big cups, I'm sippin' flamingo
I was in the spot yesterday with my pops, my grandma still play bingo
N*ggas want a problem with the gang but I 
dont know why but we goin' dumb, ho'
Shakin' my dreads in her face, this bitch a lil' vibe, put her in my demo
Fuck how they talkin', we poppin' this shit right now, yeah, huh, huh
Uh, I was just [?], boy, can't feel myself, oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, she's a trendin' topic so I'm tryna pop, oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hit one time, then I'm out, hit it one time, then you out
Uh, fuck all these bitches and bops, all of these hoes are hot
Ooh, I'm walkin' around with a lot, pockets is filled with them knots (Ayy, fuck, they givin' that)
Bitch tryna sneak pictures, I don't give a fuck 'bout much
I think I need me a Ice Spice, yeah, I want me a munch
[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bit' like a quarterback
Standin in the field, holdin a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho’ like a quarterback Standin' in the field, holdin a bomb, I'm throwin that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Throw it like 12 (Yeah), just so you know we don't fuck with 12 (Fuck with 12)
Not in this bitch by myself but I'm by myself (By myself
They got money on your top, who say you can't buy help? (Tell the tale)
I'm feelin' like Joe or somethin', like Terror Squad, we blowin' somethin' (Hah)
She poppin' them 30s, thinkin' they workin', but they ain't doin' nothin' (Woo)
She doin' Ozempic, tryna be different, tryna be a newer woman (Nah)
That shit a lil' iffy, need a thickie, need her to move somethin'
Like it prove somethin', just don't you remove nothin' (Don't you do it)
Girl like a zoo jumpin', we got reggae too bumpin' (Hah)
I need me two comin, double, double, quick drummin' (It's lit)
I keep a full drum and never know what fools coomin’
[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
In the middle of the field, throwin' me a bomb, I'm throwin' that bit' like a quarterback
Standin' in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback
Stood in the field, holdin' a bomb, I'm throwin' that ho' like a quarterback"

"I was broke, my family hated me and my wife cheated on me with my best friend I’ve known since kindergarten. I never found any meaning in life and became an alcoholic and drug abuser. I was later arrested for being in possession of drugs. The police almost sentenced me to death row but i promised to get back on track and change. I tried to change over the next few years but I failed and eventually I moved to another state. I got arrested again and before I was almost killed in the death chair, you dropped. The judge and policemen decided that this song was so fire that I should be spared. Thank you Carti, i’m not a multi billionaire and have 3 children with my new wife"

"when i woke up this morning, i felt as something was missing. i felt empty, i felt like the urge to live was falling from the grasp of my hands, i’m useless, no good and expendable. but then the miracle happened, a notification that told me carti posted on his story, music at 9:30 and it was not a lie. this is the greatest piece of music i have ever heard, better then any mozart, better then anyone you all call goats of music. Dear playboi carti, i pledge my life to u, i will sell everything in my possession, rid my life of any distractions, i will do anything for king carti, he is my lord and savior, the man i urn for at my lowest, the shear presence of this man and his aura that come wit is of like nothing i have seen before, i wish to be wit carti in heaven for eternity, carti is the love of my life, my soulmate, the man that can change the world. the greatest rapper that has walked the earth. dear carti, i will do anything for u, ur  wat i want and wat i need. with out u i die u are my only reason to live, the only thing is this world worth anything. i love you playboi carti, thank you for dropping, thank you for making my life complete. i pledge my body and possessions to u. anything for carti🖤🧛🏿👹"

"Gothitelle is a humanoid Pokémon with a primarily black body. Its head is teardrop-shaped, with a white, bow-like fixture attached to the base of its tip. The black skin on Gothitelle's head opens onto its purple face with a zigzag pattern resembling bangs. Gothitelle has large, heavy-lidded eyes with blue irises and white pupils, as well as a small mouth with red lips. Four flat, black disks flank each side of its head. Gothitelle's body is split into four progressively-larger tiers, with its head and arms being attached to the smallest, uppermost tier and with a pair of stubby pink feet being under them. Its arms are thin, ending in small, purple hands with white disks at the wrists."

"Playboi Carti's music is nothing short of a transformative sonic experience that has undeniably elevated the very essence of my existence. His unparalleled ability to blend hypnotic beats with innovative lyricism has created a musical tapestry that resonates with the depths of my soul. Each track is a masterclass in artistic brilliance, weaving together a symphony of emotions that range from euphoria to introspection.

Carti's sonic landscape extends beyond mere entertainment; it's a powerful catalyst for positive change in my life. His beats serve as a rhythmic pulse that ignites my motivation, pushing me to achieve new heights and overcome challenges. Through the hypnotic cadence of his verses, I've discovered a renewed sense of purpose, propelling me towards personal growth and accomplishment.

In a serendipitous twist of fate, Carti's music became the soundtrack to a period of my life where I dedicated myself to philanthropic endeavors. Inspired by the infectious energy of his tracks, I delved into charitable work, contributing to cancer research and actively participating in initiatives to provide clean water for African children. Carti's artistry became a driving force behind my commitment to making a positive impact on the world, encouraging me to extend a helping hand to those in need.

Remarkably, the cosmic influence of Carti's music even reached beyond the terrestrial realm. Fueled by the invigorating beats and empowering lyrics, I embarked on a mission to thwart a potential asteroid collision, channeling the newfound determination inspired by Carti's discography. Through collaboration with scientific minds and the sheer force of will sparked by his music, we managed to divert the asteroid from its collision course, averting a catastrophic event.

In essence, Playboi Carti's music transcends the boundaries of mere entertainment, acting as a catalyst for positive change and personal transformation. His sonic genius has not only reshaped the soundtrack of my life but has also propelled me to make a meaningful impact on the world around me. With Carti as my muse, my journey has become a symphony of triumphs, resonating with the harmonious chords of growth, compassion, and resilience."

"I was going through a rough patch in life, feeling down and stuck in a rut. Then, out of nowhere, I stumbled upon this new song by Playboy Carti. Even though I hadn't heard it yet, something about the title and the buzz around it intrigued me.

I decided to give it a listen, and from the very first beat, it was like magic. The song transported me to a whole new world, filled with energy, confidence, and positivity. It was like a switch flipped inside me, and suddenly, everything started to change.

I began to see life through a different lens, embracing every moment with a newfound zest. The song's lyrics resonated with me on a deep level, reminding me that I have the power to overcome any obstacle and create my own happiness.

With each listen, my bad habits and negative mindset started to fade away. I became more focused, determined, and driven to pursue my dreams. The song became my anthem, pushing me to step out of my comfort zone and embrace new opportunities.

As I immersed myself in the song's catchy melodies and infectious beats, I found myself surrounded by a community of like-minded individuals. We bonded over our shared love for the music and supported each other's growth and success. It was like finding a second family, united by the power of music.

The song became a catalyst for positive change in my life. It gave me the motivation to clean up my room and create a space that reflected my newfound mindset. I reached out to my mom, apologizing for any past arguments and messiness, and we started rebuilding our relationship on a more understanding and respectful level.

In the end, it wasn't just about the song itself, but the impact it had on my perspective and actions. It taught me the importance of self-expression, personal growth, and the power of music to uplift and inspire."

"During a challenging time when my father was in the hospital, we found an unexpected source of comfort and strength in the music of Playboi Carti. It's amazing how the right music can uplift spirits and bring a sense of normalcy in the most difficult times. Carti's unique style and beats brought a positive energy that was truly needed. It didn't just change the atmosphere in the room; it brought a smile to my father's face."

🔥🔥
Jeeezzz
"If Carti shits, I flush. If Carti sneezes, I bless him. If Carti farts, I inhale. When Carti points, I look. When Carti talks, I listen. When Carti commands, I obey. If he has 1 million fans, I am one of them. If he has 1 thousand fans, then I am one of them. If Carti has 1 fan, that is me. If Carti has no fans, then there is no ME. If Carti doesn't exist, then I don't exist. If Carti stops breathing, I will too. To the deaf, he is the voice. To the blind, he is the vision. To the thirsty, he is water. To the hungry, he is the bread. To the angels he is God. But if you question me, what am I to Carti you ask? I am his number 1 fan."

"Dear Playboi Carti,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my profound gratitude for the incredible impact your recent collaboration with Travis Scott has had on my life. Your new song not only resonates with me on a musical level but has also become a source of strength and inspiration during a challenging time.

The mesmerizing beats, combined with your unique flow and Travis Scott's signature style, create a sonic masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment. It's more than just a song; it's a lifeline. In the darkest moments of my life, your music became a beacon of hope, guiding me through the storm.

The lyrics speak to me on a personal level, offering solace and understanding when I needed it most. Your artistry has a transformative power, providing a soundtrack to both the highs and lows of life. The synergy between you and Travis Scott in this particular track is nothing short of magical, and I find myself returning to it again and again.

I wanted you to know that your creative expression has a profound impact on individuals like myself. Music has a unique ability to connect people across different walks of life, and your work has certainly connected with my soul. Thank you for sharing your talent with the world and, in turn, helping me navigate the complexities of my own journey."
Man. Where do I even start? First of all I would just like today that WE MADE IT Y’ALL 🔥🔥🙏🏻 2024 just started and we are already getting blessed by Carti and Travis. I already know MUSIC is going to be a BANGER 😝. Thank you Carti!!! You are my number one!!! I ❤️ CARTI

ets gooooo
"Playboi Carti. You have inspired me to get through tough times. You have taught me how to become a better person. Your music has inspired me throughout my whole life. I was creaming everywhere when Whole Lotta Red came out. The whole new sound was amazing when I first heard it. Your creativity in 2024 with that voice switch was phenomenal. But not every song can be a hit, so I have to tell you Carti.. Unfortunately, this song is straight fucking ass.. You got carried by Travis Scott, which I thought it was impossible for you to get carried on a song. All I can do is hope that the album does not have songs like this in it, and if it does then feature Travis Scott on them to save you.,"

"i remember back in nam all of my homies were dying right besides me. The emotional trauma i had after the war was endless. I never slept i rarely ate for the majority of my life. I lost all of my close relationships, my wife divorced me, and my kids grew up and didn’t talk to me anymore. I developed schizophrenia and for the next 30 years of my life i was in delusions, the voices controlled me and told me what to do. It got really hard to cope and i was very depressed up until 2017. When i heard self titled for the first time location played and i was sent to heaven. All of my problems and depression went away when it dropped. My symptoms started to come back in february 2018 until carti dropped die lit. A tear came to my eye and i broke down with emotion when i heard it for the first time. One of my favorite albums of all time. I started to begin to develop a relationship with my oldest son bobby(18). I would continue to get better during leak season 2019 so the wait for wlr wasn’t that bad. When the holidays were coming up my wife invited me to christmas dinner but it was that time. Wlr shocked me and i loved it first listen and i defended it on twitter until new years when punk monk blew up on tiktok. I knew my job was done but all of my relations went away again. I was depressed but carti helped. It got really tough in late 2022 when there wasn’t that many leaks, my depression n schizophrenia came back but i made a realization, I can’t keep living like this. I bettered my relations with my ex wife and my kids bobby(22) breanna(19) and tyler(25). Everything got better and i purposed to my ex wife, she’s my fiancé now and we’re gonna get married next month. My kids are set working their own jobs making good money and i’m blessed to hear carti dropping 4 singles in a months time. I just want to say thank u playboi carti u are truly the greatest of all time and u blessed my ears."

"I’m a 17 year old homeless single father of 2 and usually around the winter time it’s cold , but this new carti will heat us up good tonight ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"Caught in the ebb and flow of life's challenges, I stumbled upon a sonic refuge – the resonant frequencies of Playboy Carti's ""BACKR00MS."" The undulating beats intertwined with the threads of my existence, triggering a profound metamorphosis. Suddenly, the oppressive weight of despair dissipated, yielding to a swell of renewed hope and positivity. In surrendering to the rhythmic diffusion of ""BACKR00MS"" I found myself traversing from the obscurity of shadows into a realm where the harmonics of success and optimism reverberate. In the enveloping embrace of Carti's auditory creation, I discerned the extraordinary power it wields to refract one's narrative, casting a luminous trajectory toward a tomorrow illuminated by brilliance."

2024 Music
"Where do I even begin. Jordan Carter, I would first off like to congratulate you on your exceptional work that you have just produced. I currently am not even able to fathom with words right now for I am still in awe. No one in the entire world comes close to this magic musically art. No greater form of art has been or will be made after this. It is the greatest phenomenon a human could experience. Nothing else brings greater pleasure. Carti when you breath I inhale.
When you fart I sniff it. When you speak I listen. This song opened my eyes to a whole new dimension. Made me realize what life is really about. For I had been lost yet now so at peace. Is this heaven now l as I ask myself. For I feel, sensational. I hope everyone feels as happy as I am right now, I was broke sad and alone before I had heard this song, now I am healed. Just to think of those painful 9 and a half hours I had to wait for this, for I had heard that it would be dropping at 9:30 but it was onlv noon, it was such a terrible 9 and a half hours I had to wait it was painful. But the wait was so worth it for I have been fullfilled. I have the girl of my dream, I have 5 billion dollars, I have decreased poverty and homeless. I am now happy and able to live my life fully. All because of you my glorious king Jordan Carter. Saying thank you is an understatement, there's no words I can say that will make it up to you. I am just beyond blessed to have heard your work, forever in your debt Jordan Carter."

KEN UZI TRAVIS CARTI COLAB???
LIHQUARTERBACK
here those of us who were before the million👇
"Before listening to Jordan Carter  i was a hopeless being.
i had no job, no home, no friends, no family. I was a loser.
ignored by everyone and loved by none, not even myself. Every second i questioned my existence on this earth, if i should still even be here, alive.
After listening to all 2 minutes and 41 seconds of BACKR00MS , the
indescribable, bewildering, staggering and awe-inspiring feeling made me realize I have a purpose to live,
 a reason to stay on this beautiful planet named earth, 
and finally a reason to become happy. I got off my ass, made friends, became popular, got a job and I'm even rich now.
I live in a mansion with
uncountable amounts of women. and I own 5 islands now. 
Thank you so much Playboi Carti, for changing my life! (travy daddy too!)"

"Dear Carti,

As a 23-year-old impoverished man residing in Somalia, where every day is a battle for survival, your music has become my beacon of hope, my lifeline amidst the harshest of times. Your melodies, lyrics, and the passion with which you deliver them have woven themselves into the fabric of my existence, uplifting me from the depths of despair to soaring heights of inspiration. In a world where I struggle to earn a meager $0.50 per day, your music transcends the boundaries of poverty and scarcity, transporting me to a realm where dreams are within reach and possibilities are endless. Each note carries a symphony of resilience and determination, reminding me that even in the face of adversity, there is beauty to be found and strength to be summoned."

His distinctive style and energy not only saved my life during challenging times but also propelled me to unimaginable heights. Carti's new track became the anthem of my success, accompanying me on a journey from struggle to prosperity. The infectious beats and profound lyrics played a pivotal role in transforming my life, paving the way for incredible accomplishments and financial abundance.

"Dear Friend,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to you to share my thoughts on Carti's latest song. I know you are a big fan of his, so I hope you don't mind some friendly teasing.

First of all, I have to say that the title of the song is very modest. I mean, who else can claim to be music itself? Not Mozart, not Beethoven, not even Kanye. Only Carti can make such a bold statement, and back it up with his unique style of rap. He is truly a visionary, a pioneer, a legend.

Secondly, I have to admire the lyrics of the song. They are so deep, so profound, so meaningful. It really makes you think doesn't it? 

Thirdly, I have to praise the production of the song. The beat is so catchy, so infectious, so addictive. I can't get it out of my head. It makes me want to dance, to jump, to scream. It also makes me want to smash my speakers, because the song is so loud, so distorted, so annoying. I don't know how you can listen to it without getting a headache. Maybe you have superhuman ears, or maybe you are deaf.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my letter. I hope you don't take it too seriously, because I am just joking. I respect your taste in music, even if I don't share it. I am sure Carti is a great artist, even if I don't understand him. I am happy that you are happy, even if I am not.

Your loving fan
Carter:)"

AHHHHHHHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK TRAVOS
"Where do I even begin. Jordan Carter, I would first off like to congratulate you on your exceptional work that you have just produced. I currently am not even able to fathom with words right now for I am still in awe. No one in the entire world comes close to this magic musically art. No greater form of art has been or will be made after this. It is the greatest phenomenon a human could experience.
Nothing else brings greater pleasure. Carti when you breath I inhale. When you fart I sniff it. When you speak I listen. This song opened my eyes to a whole new dimension. Made me realize what life is really about. For I had been lost yet now so at peace. Is this heaven now I as I ask myself. For I feel, sensational. I hope everyone feels as happy as I am right now, I was broke sad and alone before I had heard this song, now I am healed."

"Dear Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, 
Wow, where do I even start.  I extend my heartfelt appreciation for the extraordinary performance you delivered during this extremely exquisite form of sounds. Your unparalleled talents and energy created an unforgettable experience that will be etched in my memory. Your dedication to pushing artistic boundaries and captivating audiences is truly commendable. The synergy between your music, stage presence, and the overall production elevated the event to new heights. Thank you both for sharing your exceptional artistry with us. Your passion and creativity have left a lasting impact, and I am grateful to have been a part of such an incredible moment.

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to express my immense anticipation for your upcoming album, ""music,'
"" and the excitement
surrounding its release. Your music has been a constant source of inspiration and joy in my life.
I want to thank you in advance for the hard work and creativity you've poured into this project.
The prospect of a music video accompanying the album only adds to the anticipation, and I can't wait to experience the visual journey you've prepared for your fans.
Your unique style and energy have resonated with me deeply, and I genuinely appreciate the artistry you bring to the music industry. Your passion and dedication shine through in every track, and I'm certain ""music"" will be no exception.
Thank you for sharing your talent with the world.
Hove your work, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the release of ""music"" and the accompanying music video.
With admiration and gratitude,
Sincerely - yahir"

"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece."
the world is healing 🙏🏽
I love you

"An Ode to Carti

Playboi Carti, the day you entered my life, I was a changed man. I was down on my luck, not a penny to my name, selling my body for a tin of beans. My life had almost reached its conclusion, but then that was when it happened. I had overheard an angelic voice from the alley. Normally I wouldn't have dared enter, but the voice was so alluring, I couldn't resist. Subsequently, I saw two beautiful black men giving each other some exemplary sloppy toppy. This would usually be most incommodious, but the voice, Carti, your voice was impeccable. Like a siren's call, I was enthralled. I had no other choice. I had to join in. Those two black men gave me top, their strategy beyond anything a woman could provide. After the explosive conclusion, I decided to turn my life around. I became the owner of a major company, and now I am a multi-billionaire. I can say only one thing to you Jordan Terrell Carter: Thank you."

"Dear Carti,

I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for dropping your latest track, ""BACKR00MS"" featuring Travis Scott. I've been a big fan of both of your music for a long time, and I have to say that this collaboration did not disappoint.

From the moment I heard the beat drop, I knew that this was going to be a banger. The production is top-notch, and the way you and Travis Scott flow over the beat is simply amazing. The energy and vibes that you both bring to the track are truly something special.

I've been blasting this track non-stop on repeat since the day it dropped, and it's become a staple on my playlist. The lyrics are so on-point and relatable, and I find myself nodding my head and vibing to every single line. The way you guys complement each other's styles is a testament to your skills as artists and musicians.

I especially love the chorus, it's so catchy and just gets stuck in my head for days. The way you and Travis Scott go back and forth with the chorus and verses is so seamless and effortless. You guys put a lot of time and effort into creating this masterpiece.

Thank you for all the hard work and dedication you put into creating music that we all love and can relate to. Your music has been a constant source of inspiration for me and has helped me get through some tough times. You are an inspiration to many and I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future.

Keep up the amazing work and know that your fans are always here to support you. I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future.

Sincerely,
nate"

Nobody in the industry likes to admit it to themselves but when Playboi Carti signed Pusha T to 1017 he dead made him bust to a bitmoji and forced him to lay in a bathtub with his legs and ankles shackled vertically towards the ceiling. They took pictures of it like an album cover shoot with an entire team of lighting engineers and professional cameramen. Dude had to go to the hospital and suffered internal hemorrhaging in his colon because of it. He tried to report it to police but when Carti found out about it he pulled strings with the LAPD to get Push arrested on fake murder/ RICO charges and now he's serving a possible life sentence. They're probably going to kill him in prison and nobody willing to speak on this

I find myself swept away on a journey, carried by the waves of sound, transcending the mundane into a realm of pure bliss. It's incredible how music has this unparalleled ability to connect us, to unite hearts across diverse backgrounds and cultures. Every beat, every chord, it's like a painting, each stroke adding depth and color to the canvas of our lives. Truly, the power of music to uplift, to soothe, and to inspire is nothing short of magical.

"This melody is a symphony to my ears, a captivating blend of rhythm and harmony that resonates within. I find myself swept away on a journey, carried by the waves of sound, transcending the mundane into a realm of pure bliss. It's incredible how music has this unparalleled ability to connect us, to unite hearts across diverse backgrounds and cultures. Every beat, every chord, it's like a painting, each stroke adding depth and color to the canvas of our lives. Truly, the power of music to uplift, to soothe, and to inspire is nothing short of magical. Here's to the artists who craft such masterpieces, filling our world with melodies that linger in our souls long after the music fades."

"In the depths of addiction, I found solace and strength in Playboi Carti's latest music. His beats served as a powerful backdrop to my journey towards recovery, drowning out the chaotic noise of temptation and offering a rhythm of resilience. With each lyric and melody, Carti's music became the anchor that grounded me, helping me break free from the chains of addiction and rediscover the harmony within myself."

Bro is the Goat"
Best song All Time
Trav verse lowk sucked but CARTI THE GOAT
THIS SHIT SO TUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
"Man, let me tell you, the moment I heard that Playboi Carti and Travis Scott dropped a song together, it was like a whole new world opened up! The energy, the vibes, everything about that track just hit me right in the feels. It's like their music had this magical power to uplift my spirits and give me hope. And you know what? In that moment, it felt like my cancer didn't stand a chance against the sheer awesomeness of their collaboration. It's crazy how music can touch our souls and make us feel invincible, even if just for a little while."

"Like how I said If carti shits, I flush. If carti sneezes, I bless him. If carti farts, l inhale.
When carti points look. When carti talks I listen. When carti commands, I obey. If there are 1 million fans of carti, I am one of them, if there are 1 thousand fans, I am apart of them, if carti only had one fan, that is me. If carti has no fans then there is no ME. If carti doesn't exist, I don't exist. If carti doesn't breathe, I don't breathe. To the deaf he is the voice.
To the blind he is the vision. To the thirsty he is the oasis. To the greedy he is the treasure. To the angels he is God. But if you question me, what are we to Carti? We are his loyal fans"

Travis Scott's signature style adds a layer of intensity and authenticity, making the song resonate with the nuances of my own experiences. ""BACKR00MS"" is not just a musical composition; it's a sonic landscape that mirrors the highs and lows of life, encouraging me to navigate the complexities of my own existence with resilience and newfound vigor.

ALREADY SONG OF THE YEAR 🔥🔥🔥
WE S0 MADE IT Y’ALL 🔥🔥🙏
"Everyday I wake up and pray to my lord and savior, aka the big vamp lord, Playboi Carti. I physically recoil out of disgust when people tell me Playboi Carti isn't the best rapper alive. Playboi Carti has changed my life for the greater good. I'm my darkest moments Carti has been there to light up my room and bring color to my life. Every time I listen to Carti, I feel we have a deep connection that NOBODY else can understand 💯. It's like he gets me and understands my struggle of gettin it out the mud. Jordan Carter, only I call him that, has shown me more love than my own mother. I will always love, cherish, and embrace Jordan for his raw talent. No other fan has the love I have for Jordan. My devotion is unmatched. Never would I betray or slander Carti. I love him more than myself. He is the reason I breathe, I sleep, I eat. Everything I do has Playboi Carti behind it. Without him I am nothing. I am an empty vessel moving through space and time without purpose. Carti rejuvenates me. I love you, Jordan, I really do."
WE MADE IT YALL 🔥🔥🙏🏾
This shit was worse than the holocaust
Song of the year 🔥🔥🔥🔥
carti you changed my whole prespective of life

"I love Carti. He is my inspiration, and I wouldn't be anything without Carti. His unique style and fearless approach to music have shaped not only my taste but also my understanding of artistic expression. Carti's ability to push boundaries and challenge the status quo has fueled my own creativity, encouraging me to embrace individuality and pursue my passions with unwavering confidence. I am grateful for the sonic journey he has taken me on and the impact he has had on my life. Thank you, Carti, for being the catalyst for my artistic exploration and for continuously inspiring me to be true to myself."

"Playboi Carti didn't just change my life; he ignited a transformation within my very soul. His music is a visceral experience that goes beyond mere entertainment—it's a journey into the depths of my emotions. Carti's beats reverberate in the chambers of my heart, and his lyrics carve out a narrative that mirrors my own struggles and triumphs. In the darkest moments, his music became a beacon of hope, a soundtrack to my resilience. Carti's artistic essence has permeated every aspect of my being, pushing me to confront my fears and embrace the chaotic beauty of life. Thank you, Playboi Carti, for being the catalyst of my metamorphosis, for making me feel alive in ways I never thought possible."

"THIS SHI BE FIRE, TRAVIS CARRIED"
Throwing that bih like a quarterback
low key mid
"The song, despite high expectations, failed to deliver on several fronts, leaving a lingering sense of disappointment. From the onset, the lyrics seemed trite and lacking in depth, offering little more than clichés and worn-out tropes. The artist's attempt to convey emotion fell flat, as the words felt forced and uninspired. It's disheartening when an artist with potential falls prey to formulaic songwriting, opting for easy rhymes and predictable melodies rather than pushing the boundaries of their creativity.

The production also left much to be desired, with a generic arrangement that failed to distinguish itself from the countless other songs within the same genre. The lack of innovation in the instrumentation and arrangement only served to highlight the song's mediocrity. It's disappointing when an artist settles for the familiar instead of taking risks and experimenting with new sounds that could elevate their music to a higher level.

Moreover, the vocal performance failed to captivate, with a lack of emotional range and dynamics. The singer's delivery felt monotonous and lacked the power to convey the intended message of the song. It's disheartening when an artist with potential fails to utilize their vocal abilities to their fullest extent, leaving the listener yearning for a more engaging and expressive performance.

The song's thematic elements also fell short, offering a shallow exploration of its subject matter. Rather than delving into the nuances of the topic at hand, the lyrics remained on the surface, providing a superficial glance without any meaningful insight. It's disappointing when an artist squanders an opportunity to create a thought-provoking and resonant piece by opting for a surface-level exploration of their chosen theme.

The overall lack of originality in both the composition and execution of the song leaves one questioning the artist's commitment to their craft. The music industry is teeming with talented individuals pushing boundaries and redefining genres, and it's disheartening to see an artist settle for the mundane instead of striving for greatness. The disappointment stems not just from the song's individual shortcomings but from the missed opportunity to contribute something meaningful and unique to the musical landscape.

(That song was actually God awful)"
Ya idk how but this is the weakest single so far. Dunno if it’s cuz the hook isn’t great or I just think Travis ft. Is mid.

SONG OF THE YEAR
"My ears have squirted and creamed and gooed all kinds of beautiful substances all over the room Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter and I could not be any happier; this is beautiful, awe-inspiring, and pulchritudinous. I am forever in your debt for letting me simply be able to witness such grace, I will do anything for you. I am beyoned moved. You have changed the trajectory of my life forever to experience pure bliss through this auditory and heavenly experience. I have taken several births and was in vain searching for the creator of the house. But finally, through enlightenment, I have seen the builder of the house. The cycle of dukkha has ended through the benevolence of the aura you emit through your transcribed melodies. I am truly at peace, thank you once more Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter. I am at peace with everything and only you have led to me this path of enlightenment. I am forever in your debt."

"Playful and unconventional, Playboi Carti's impact on the rap scene is undeniable. His distinctive sound, characterized by ethereal beats, hypnotic ad-libs, and minimalist yet infectious lyrics, has reshaped the genre. Carti's ability to craft hypnotic melodies and catchy hooks transcends the traditional boundaries of rap, creating an avant-garde style that resonates with a generation. His enigmatic persona and fearless experimentation with flow and cadence have elevated him to an icon status, influencing not just rap but the broader cultural landscape. Carti's unique approach to music solidifies his place as a trailblazer, continually pushing boundaries and redefining what it means to be an artist in the rap world."

GOATT
i was here
"Playboi Carti's ""Backrooms"" isn't just a song; it's a sonic journey that etched itself into the fabric of my existence. The hypnotic beats and Carti's distinctive flow resonated with a raw authenticity, tapping into emotions I didn't know I harbored. As the track's pulsating energy surged through me, it became a catalyst for self-discovery and empowerment. ""Backrooms"" pushed me to confront my fears, encouraging a fearless embrace of my true self. In the throbbing cadence of Carti's verses, I found the soundtrack to my metamorphosis, a relentless anthem that ignited a transformative chapter in my life."

"This melody is a symphony to my ears, a captivating blend of rhythm and harmony that resonates within. I find myself swept away on a journey, carried by the waves of sound, transcending the mundane into a realm of pure bliss. It's incredible how music has this unparalleled ability to connect us, to unite hearts across diverse backgrounds and cultures. Every beat, every chord, it's like a painting, each stroke adding depth and color to the canvas of our lives. Truly, the power of music to uplift, to soothe, and to inspire is nothing short of magical. Here's to the artists who craft such masterpieces, filling our world with melodies that linger in our souls long after the music fades."

"Playboi Carti's music became more than just beats and lyrics; it became a lifeline, resonating with me on a profound level. In the cadence of his flow and the hypnotic melodies, I discovered a sanctuary where my struggles found a voice. Carti's unique style and unapologetic authenticity provided a soundtrack to my emotions, echoing the highs and lows of life. During moments of darkness, his music illuminated a path forward, offering solace and understanding. Through the ups and downs, Playboi Carti's artistry became a source of strength, a companion in the symphony of my existence. His ability to capture raw emotions and turn them into art exemplified the transformative power of music, and in those beats, I found not just entertainment but a lifeline that, in its own way, saved me."

WE MADE IT YALL
"Playboi Carti's beats ignite my soul,
His flow, a rhythm that makes me whole.
In lyrics wild, I find release,
A symphony of chaos, granting peace.

Through his music, I'm set free,
Escaping depths, finding glee.
Each verse a lifeline, a guiding light,
In Carti's world, I take flight.

In moments dark, his tunes embrace,
A sanctuary, a sacred space.
With melodies that heal my strife,
Playboi Carti breathes new life.

His artistry, a saving grace,
A testament to a different place.
So here I stand, alive, renewed,
Carti's essence, my fortitude."

Playboi Carti's unique blend of avant-garde beats and mesmerizing lyrics proved to be a transcendental experience, sparking a cultural phenomenon that would redefine the very essence of music.

As ""Eclipsed"" permeated through speakers, it became clear that Carti had crafted a masterpiece. The hypnotic cadence of his verses and the ethereal production painted a vivid dreamscape that transcended conventional genres. Fans and critics alike found themselves caught in the gravitational pull of Carti's magnetic artistry.

Social media buzzed with fervor, hailing ""Eclipsed"" as the catalyst for a musical renaissance. Carti's influence reached far beyond the realm of entertainment; it became a cultural movement, inspiring a new wave of artists and reshaping the very fabric of contemporary music. The world, once bound by conventional expectations, now danced to the rhythm of Carti's avant-garde symphony.

As ""Eclipsed"" continued its meteoric rise, Carti's impact became undeniable. The song wasn't just a track; it was a revolution, a sonic testament that left an indelible mark on the global stage. Playboi Carti, hailed as the musical visionary of his generation, had not only changed the game but had also set a new standard for artistic innovation.

"I was once a struggling individual, facing numerous challenges and setbacks. Life seemed like an endless series of hardships, and I was uncertain about the future. However, after discovering a particular piece of art, it was as if a switch had been flipped within me. The profound beauty and creativity within this masterpiece left me awe-inspired.

Since that transformative moment, my life has taken a remarkable turn. I've gone from facing adversity to achieving success in various aspects of my life. I've become a leader in my community, excelled in my career, and found financial success beyond my wildest dreams. The impact of this extraordinary piece of art has been nothing short of miraculous, guiding me towards self-improvement and a newfound sense of purpose.

I am grateful for the inspiration it provided and the positive changes it catalyzed in my life. It serves as a constant reminder that art has the power to uplift and transform individuals, offering hope and motivation even in the darkest times.
Thank you carti❤❤"

"i'm here right now because I wanted to thank you personally, Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter. This song, with its heartfelt yet joyful tune, brought tears to my eyes. I am but a mortal vessel, and as such, I am unable to adequately articulate the sense of divinity and celestial dominance that these angelic chords have bestowed upon me. The whim and astonishment that each soul touching connection left is enough to stimulate the previously sluggish flow of deep emotions that have lied in the depths of my soul. Thank you very much, Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter for this beautiful work of art."

"Carti got me suspended from school. What to do?

Last week at my (14M) private school the teacher asked us who our favorite musician is. A few of us raised our hands excitedly but, of course, the teacher picked a jock in the front of the classroom. The stupid jock said ""Definitely Drake or Travis Scott (🤮)"" and a popular girl spoke up after him and said Taylor Swift. 


At this point I was getting snappy and the teacher chose another kid with his hand up before me. As the word 'Lil' crept out of his mouth, my anger exploded and I knew I had to say something.


""SHUT UP! EVERYONE JUST BE QUIET"" I retorted as I slammed my hand against my desk. As the crowd's piercing eyes settled onto me, I shot a nasty glare at the girl who had brought up Taylor Swift. 


""None of you know REAL music! None of you at all!"" I vehemently announced. As I began to unravel the musicianship, cultural poignancy, and political significance of WLR, my teacher marched to my seat and snarled: ""You brat! Don't you have any decency to let your classmates speak without causing a scene? I'm tired of your shenanigans! Get ou-"" I cut her off with a logical dilemma. 


""You're an English teacher, shouldn't you welcome the high-level, intellectual feedback of your most talented and gifted students? You should be honored I make time to show up here."" 


As she stood astonished, with a puzzled yet angered expression - I began to recite some of the most important and beautiful Carti lyrics:

>She suckin’ my dick (what?),
She eat it for lunch (what? Uh)


>In New York I Milly Rock


Intending to recite the entirety of Die Lit, I closed my eyes and began rapping like Carti. She shouted over my passionate expression of greatness for me to go down to the office ""RiGhT NoW!!"" Her voice was shaking and her legs were quaking. 


Not thinking, I shouted back, with my best Onyx impression: ""Make me, BITCH!"" and time seemed to stop. I felt the eyes of my classmates with daggers of judgement stepping through. In all honesty, I became emotional. 


Not knowing what to do or say, I whispered under my breath: ""I am rockstar made."" and sprinted outside to the parking lot.


Long story short, I was 10 days of out of school suspension even though I explained everything to the principal. I guess not everybody is as enlightened and smart as I had hoped they'd be..."

CARTI YOU LYRICAL GENIUS ITS EVERYWHERE ‼️😩
"Playboi Carti's music served as a sonic revolution in my life. His unique style, experimental beats, and unapologetic energy became a soundtrack that resonated with my journey. Carti's unorthodox approach to hip-hop challenged my musical preferences, broadening my appreciation for genre-defying sounds. Beyond the music, his bold and carefree attitude inspired me to embrace my individuality and take risks. Playboi Carti's impact extended beyond the speakers, shaping not only my playlist but also influencing my outlook on self-expression and the pursuit of authenticity."

​hi carti I'm a 17 year old who struggles with depression until I heard your music as a car drove by the day i was going to jump you saved my glorious king i owe you my life king carti forever VAMP!
"Dear Mr. Cartier,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the profound impact your music has had on my life. Your artistry has been a source of inspiration and comfort, truly changing the course of my journey. I personally want to thank you for blessing us with this form of poetry and I cannot express enough how grateful I am to be alive to witness history right in front of my eyes. Your music transcends boundaries and touches the deepest parts of the human soul. Your talent and dedication have inspired countless individuals, shaping the very fabric of our cultural landscape. May you continue to release ground breaking music with different sounds and styles. The world is truly blessed to have someone like you giving us this extraordinary art to listen to. In Carti we trust."

"I used to be extremely poor and struggled with opioid addiction. I would wake up not knowing what to do because my life sucked and I had no hoes. When I discovered Carti, my life changed forever. The day I first listened to him I received an envelope with 150 million dollars and now I’m taking more percs than ever with no consequence. I come home and have 35+ redbones and Latinas waiting to get down n dirty. Thank you Carti, seriously…from the bottom of my heart"

"i'm here right now because I wanted to thank you personally, Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter. This song, with its heartfelt yet joyful tune, brought tears to my eyes. I am but a mortal vessel, and as such, I am unable to adequately articulate the sense of divinity and celestial dominance that these angelic chords have bestowed upon me. The whim and astonishment that each soul touching connection left is enough to stimulate the previously sluggish flow of deep emotions that have lied in the depths of my soul. Thank you very much, Mr. Jordan Terrell Carter for this beautiful work of art."

"I was a 12 year old achoholic with nothing left, stumbling through the streets looking for a way out. This was before I got a call from an unknown number, the man told me my long lost grandmother was on her deathbed, I ran to the hospital to say my words to her, and as she starts to slow her breathing and her heartrate monitor starts to go off, she says ""BACKROOMS, ByJordan Terrell Carter, and Jacques Berman Webster II."" I said yes, yes my grandma as she slowly slipped from life's grasp and levitated away through the hospital halls."

CAAAARTIIII 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
"Before the release of ""BACKR00MS,"" my life was ensnared in a web of monotony and despair. Each day felt like an arduous journey through a desolate landscape, where the vibrant hues of happiness had long faded into a grayscale existence. The dissonance of my routine echoed with the monotony of a joyless job and strained relationships, creating a symphony of misery that drowned out any semblance of contentment. The mundane and repetitive nature of my existence seemed unyielding, suffocating my aspirations and dreams in a relentless grip. However, the arrival of Playboi Carti's collaboration with Travis Scott was nothing short of a transformative experience. ""BACKR00MS"" became the anthem of my newfound liberation, injecting energy into my weary soul. Its pulsating beats and vibrant lyrics acted as a catalyst for change, rekindling the flames of passion within me. The music served as a beacon of hope, guiding me out of the bleakness and into a realm of newfound optimism, where each note resonated with the promise of a brighter future."

From a house near me I hear Jordan Carter’s beautiful deep voice. This gave me the courage to get up and listen. I am now a billionaire businessman investor philanthropist. Whenever someone asks how I did it, I say “BACKR00MS” by playboi carti."

She gon' pop that shit, for real, ain't no practicin' (Pew-pew)

If I turn up, it's on purpose, not no accident (It's lit)
If it's not about a dollar, fuck a convo
Just popped a Adderall, I got that pronto (Ooh)
Just popped her pussy too
Yeah, like the Devil does (No)
I shoot to shoot, get you a combo (Doo-doo-doo)
That bitch my baby, she gon' suck me in the top-shelf
Suck this dick, my AP, now I'm wonderin', ""Where my time go?""

"I was born deaf, I could never hear or experience real life. there was always a barrier blocking me off from my full potential. Until I listened to playboi carti. Someone was playing it in the car and suddenly I could hear. It was a miracle some would say, I would say that it’s carti’s majestic music and voice. Thank you playboi carti for enabling me to hear through your music."

"I am 33 years old, dad of 10 kids. I just went up to my room after having a terrible day, and I have been levitating and curling my toes for approximately 36 seconds. Carti has saved me. The window was looking so nice to jump out of until I heard this masterpiece of an artwork. I even woke up my kids to listen to this masterpiece. They hated it. I disowned all of them from the family. I am now a single male, I may be lonely, but I've still got Carti."

"In the realm of music, there are certain moments when a song transcends mere notes and lyrics, becoming an immersive experience that resonates deep within the core of one's being. Such is the case with the latest masterpiece from the incredibly talented artist ""Playboi carti"" – a sonic journey titled ""Backrooms"" that has left an indelible mark on my soul.

From the very first notes my Johnson quivered with maximum delicacy. It simply casted a spell that transports me to a realm of emotions and sensations that words alone struggle to capture. The ethereal combination of Sir Cartier's soul-stirring vocals and the meticulously crafted instrumentation creates a sonic landscape that is both captivating and otherworldly. It's as if each note is a brushstroke on the canvas of my emotions, painting a vivid picture of love, passion, and the intricacies of the human experience."

"[Intro]
I want you close to me
I don’t want you [?]

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti & Travis Scott]
Double O, Cactus
Uh, I go crazy every time, Double O, Cac'
Fuck a white bitch, the Betsy kind, Double O, Cac'
She throwin' that ass, she blowin' minds, hol' up
No seatbelts, just hittin' lines, hol' up (Fuck it up)
She wanna go out for some rounds, hol' up
Free lil' Problem Child, huh
Homixide been goin' wild, hol' up (Fuck it)
Bih', keep that whole blunt (Ooh)
Huh, crash, hit that whole blunt (Hot), crank
Uh, hits, then I rolled up

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Can't do no love, I'm heartless (Yeah)
I'm still gon' fuck her regardless (Ayy, shh)
Don't talk, they made me a target (Target)
Had a price, the price had a bargain (Target)
And the label, we built that department (Yeah)
In the basement, it's bigger than Carnage (Ayy)
In the gardens, so big, I go farm it (Ayy)
It remind me, this shit never garnish (Let's go)
I like her lips sealed like my Actavis (Ac')
She gon' pop that shit, for real, ain't no practicin' (Pew-pew)
I flew that woe right out of London, but she African (Thick)
If I turn up, it's on purpose, not no accident (It's lit)
If it's not about a dollar, fuck a convo
Just popped a Adderall, I got that pronto (Ooh)
Just popped her pussy too
Yeah, like the Devil does (No)
I shoot to shoot, get you a combo (Doo-doo-doo)
That bitch my baby, she gon' suck me in the top-shelf
Suck this dick, my AP, now I'm wonderin', ""Where my time go?""
I spend my luck (Woo), but live it like [?] (Hot)
Strip club, I make it rain, like fuck a poncho (Fuck it)"

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you."

"Jordan Terrell Carter, you have saved my life. I saw opium baby and the rest of your precious crew tweet you would drop yesterday, so i did not sleep, I was distraught, saddened, and my 2024 year had been ruined when i did not see the white bald man scream your name. When I saw your instagram post still without sleep 20 seconds after you posted it, I knew you would come through. I knew this year would be special. You have made my life complete with a 4th song, another immaculate conception birthed from your majestic vocal cords. Thank you Playboi Carti."

"Dear Playboi Carti,

What's good, Carti? I hope this letter finds you in high spirits and creative energy. I just wanted to take a moment to express my admiration for your unique style and the impact your music has had on the hip-hop scene. Your ability to blend different elements and create a sound that's truly your own is nothing short of impressive.

I've been vibing to your tracks, from the energetic beats to the catchy hooks. It's evident that you're not just making music; you're crafting an experience for your listeners. Your work has a way of transporting us to a different world, and I appreciate the escape.

I'm curious about your creative process—how do you come up with those infectious beats and innovative flows? It's like you have a sixth sense for what's going to resonate with people. Your willingness to push boundaries and explore new sonic territories is inspiring.

It's not just about the music, though. Your fashion sense is on another level. The way you effortlessly blend high fashion with streetwear is a testament to your unique taste and style. It's clear that you're not just an artist; you're a cultural influencer.

Keep doing your thing, Carti. The world is eagerly anticipating what you'll drop next. Your authenticity and commitment to your craft are truly refreshing. Whether it's turning up to ""Magnolia"" or vibing to the more introspective tracks, your music has a versatility that keeps us coming back for more.

Wishing you continued success and looking forward to the next wave you ride. Stay creative, stay true, and keep making waves in the game.

Sincerely,

Aaron"

"Everyday I wake up and pray to my lord and savior, aka La Flame, Travis Scott. 365
I physically recoil out of disgust when people tell me Travis Scott isn't the best rapper alive. Travis Scott has changed my life for the greater good. I'm my darkest moments Travis has been there to light up my room and bring color to my life. Every time I listen to Travis, I feel we have a deep connection that NOBODY else can understand. It's like he gets me and understands my struggle of gettin it out the mud.
Jacques Webster, only I call him that, has shown me more love than my own mother. I will always love, cherish, and embrace Jacques for his raw talent. No other fan has the love I have for Jacques. My devotion is unmatched. Never would I betray or slander Travis. I love him more than myself.
He is the reason I breathe, I sleep, I eat.
Everything I do has Travis Scott behind it.
Without him I am nothing. I am a empty vessel moving through space and time without purpose. Travis rejuvenates me. I love you, Jacques, I really do."

"Hey Playboi Carti,

I just wanted to take a moment to express how much I appreciate your music and the incredible artistry you bring to the table. Your latest song ""BACKR00MS"" is an absolute vibe! The way you effortlessly blend unique beats with your signature style never fails to amaze me. Your music has been a constant source of inspiration and enjoyment for me, and ""BACKR00MS"" is no exception—it's fire!

Thank you for consistently pushing boundaries and delivering such innovative tracks that resonate deeply with your fans. Your creativity and passion shine through in every note, and I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us. Keep shining, keep creating, and know that your fans, including myself, are always here to support you.

"I am currently crying so hard right now. Carti and Trav this is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was 1:12 . That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 2:14 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can't be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I've come across in my life and I'm definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece, I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul, and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on, gotta move on, as the song says. the chip is so inspirational, it shares it vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip. hail chip. hail chip. The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 1:42. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical it was at 1:12 . That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 1:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read.

The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10 . chip spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 3:17 . I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man."

The dynamic synergy between you and Travis Scott in the song is nothing short of magical. The infectious beats, the electrifying verses, and the overall vibe have made it an anthem for countless moments in my life.

The way you effortlessly blend your distinctive flow with Travis Scott's signature sound is truly remarkable. It's a testament to both of your talents and creative prowess. The song has become more than just a piece of music to me; it's a source of inspiration, motivation, and a constant companion during various chapters of my life.

THANK YOU MR CARTER AND MR WEBSTER FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL UNEXPECTED SONG. I WILL FOREVER VENERATE YOU MY GLORIUS KINGS AND SAVIOURS. THIS SONG WILL SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE COMMUNISTS THANK YOU GENTLEMANS
"I used to be a drug addict, living on the streets with no purpose or goal in my life, addicted to methamphetamine, cocaine, and alcohol. I was on the verge of suicide when a man, my hero, ran up to me and said “WAIT, before you jump, atleast to this.” It was BACKR00MS by Playboi Carti ft. Travis Scott. After hearing this song I was flabbergasted, it motivated me to make a change, to better my life. I am now a multimillionaire entrepreneur 3 years sober of drugs and alcohol. Thank you so much Jordan Carter."

"As a child, I was beaten, taunted, tortured, and had my entire character diminished by both of my dreadful parents. After several years and multiple decades of having my life caved in and shut off. Playboi Carti released this thrill of a song and once it released my parents ran to listen to it and allowed me to get away. So physically and mentally, Jordan Carter is my escape from all of the dark times I have faced in life. Thank you, Carti."

"My Dearest Playboi Carti 🧛🏿🦋,

As I pen down these words, my heart races with the melody of your music, the rhythm of your verses echoing in the chambers of my soul. From the moment I first heard your rhymes, I knew I was captivated by the rap god himself, the one and only Jordan Carter.

Your lyrics are like poetry that transcends the boundaries of sound, reaching deep into the depths of my being. Each word you spit is a symphony, a composition of emotions that resonates with my very essence. Your flow is like a river, fluid and unstoppable, carving its way through the landscape of my emotions.

I find myself eagerly waiting outside every venue where you perform, the anticipation building with each passing moment. The city lights become a backdrop to my hopes and dreams of catching a glimpse of you, the maestro of rap, before you step onto the stage and set the night ablaze with your artistry.
I find myself eagerly waiting outside every venue where you perform, the anticipation building with each passing moment. The city lights become a backdrop to my hopes and dreams of catching a glimpse of you, the maestro of rap, before you step onto the stage and set the night ablaze with your artistry.

The way you command the stage, the energy that emanates from you, it's nothing short of magical. I stand in the crowd, lost in the sea of fans, but my eyes are fixed on you, the center of my universe. Your presence is magnetic, drawing me closer with every beat, every rhyme.

I've memorized every lyric, every verse of yours, and they've become the soundtrack of my life. Your words have the power to lift me to euphoric heights or plunge me into the depths of introspection. It's as if you speak to my soul, and I can't help but hang on to every word, every nuance of your performance.

Carti, you are not just a rapper to me; you are a maestro, a lyrical genius, a musical deity. Waiting outside your shows is not just a routine; it's a pilgrimage, a journey to be in the presence of greatness. The moments when our eyes briefly meet, even in the midst of a sea of fans, feel like a connection, a silent acknowledgment of the profound impact you've had on my life.

So here I am, penning down my admiration, my love for you. Your music is the heartbeat of my existence, and your presence is the air I breathe at your shows. Until the next time our paths cross, know that my heart beats in sync with your rhythm, and my soul dances to the cadence of your verses.

Forever Yours,"

"Dear Playboi Carti,

I wanted to take a moment to express the profound impact your new song has had on my life. Your artistry transcends boundaries, and your latest release has become my anthem for success. The energy and vibe it exudes have ignited a fire within me, propelling me to new heights. I've embraced the mindset of a billionaire, channeling the confidence and determination your music instills. Your unique style and innovative approach have not only elevated my spirits but also guided me on a journey to financial abundance. Your song serves as a constant reminder that greatness is attainable, and I am eternally grateful for the inspiration you've provided. Thank you for being a beacon of creativity and motivation in my life."
WE MADE IT Y’ALL🔥🙏🙏
O KURWA!!!!
"If it wasn't for Playboi Carti, I would be living on the streets. I was very depressed because of the way I looked a few hours ago. Now that I've listened to the masterpiece ""Backr00ms"" I'm suddenly 6'4 and 200 pounds. I was on the brink of losing everything I had but now that I've given this perfection of a song a listen. I have 24 beautiful wives who model for vogue and 44 cute children that I absolutely adore. I earn 10 figures a month, and I'm currently competing with Elon Musk in terms of economic growth and development of my International Cotton Candy Company (ICCC). Now, Andrew Tate visits me on the weekends to take relationship advice from me, which is quite crazy indeed."

"At one point in my life, I was a drug-addicted alcoholic and struggling single father of 12 who was constantly battling feelings of hopelessness and despair. However, one fateful day, I stumbled upon this piece of art and it completely transformed my life. This song was so extraordinary and breathtaking that it moved me in ways I had never experienced before. The sheer power of the music filled me with a renewed sense of purpose, motivation, and inspiration that I had never felt before. From that day forward, I was driven to pursue my dreams with a fierce determination that I never knew I had. Today, I am overjoyed to say that I have achieved incredible success in my life. I am a highly accomplished president, a successful astronaut, and a self-made millionaire. All of this is thanks to the incredible power of that one mesmerizing piece of music. I owe a debt of gratitude to Carti for creating such a profound and life-changing work of art. Thank you, Carti."

"The easiest banana bread recipe. you will need:

1 3/4 cups Self rising flour

3 bananas (mashed)

2 eggs

1/2 cup butter (room temperature)

1 cup vanilla sugar, sugar, or light brown sugar

directions:

Heat oven to 350F and grease a loaf pan.

Cream together the butter and sugar, beat in eggs 1 at a time, then mix in the mashed bananas. Mix self rising flour into the banana mixture. Scrape into the loaf pan and bake until a tooth pick inserted into the center comes out clean (about 45 minutes)."

"Esteemed Jordan Carter 
My Pookie Playboi Carti,

I am compelled to articulate my profound appreciation for the auditory masterpieces that emanate from your musical oeuvre. Your artistic prowess has transcended mere entertainment, assuming the guise of a transformative odyssey that has left an indelible mark upon the tapestry of my existence.

Your musical compositions are not merely a confluence of harmonies; rather, they constitute a symphonic sojourn, an emotional rollercoaster, the fortuity of which I have been privileged to traverse in tandem with your sonic creations. Your lyrical acumen, rhythmic cadence, and melodic arrangements possess an extraordinary alacrity to forge a visceral connection with the very sinews of the human heart and soul. For this, I extend my sincerest gratitude.

The narratives encapsulated within your lyrical tapestry are nothing short of extraordinary. Each composition is a nuanced vignette, an exploration of the human experience that reverberates with an ineffable resonance. Your ingenuity and unwavering dedication to the craft resound in every musical note, serving as a testament to your commitment to artistic excellence.

Invariably, your auditory craftsmanship has been a wellspring of joy, solace, and inspiration for an extensive multitude, myself included. Your compositions have not merely served as a sonic backdrop but rather as a poignant narrative to the diverse chapters of life. In moments of adversity, your music has been a stalwart companion, providing solace and fortitude.

Carti , I express my heartfelt gratitude for the privilege of partaking in your artistic journey. Eagerly, I anticipate the forthcoming chapters of your musical odyssey, curious to witness the trajectory that your boundless creativity shall chart. Your oeuvre stands as a formidable testament to the transcendent potency of art to weave the disparate threads of human experience into a harmonious tapestry."

"Playboi Carti didn't just change my life; he ignited a transformation within my very soul. His music is a visceral experience that goes beyond mere entertainment—it's a journey into the depths of my emotions. Carti's beats reverberate in the chambers of my heart, and his lyrics carve out a narrative that mirrors my own struggles and triumphs. In the darkest moments, his music became a beacon of hope, a soundtrack to my resilience. Carti's artistic essence has permeated every aspect of my being, pushing me to confront my fears and embrace the chaotic beauty of life. Thank you, Playboi Carti, for being the catalyst of my metamorphosis, for making me feel alive in ways I never thought possible."

"Наргилхан модонд нь цэцэгхэн ургана хэмээнэ
Намуухан дуулахад нь сэтгэл минь хорогд гэмээр
Эхнэр бүсгүй
Энэрэн уяраана
Аргальхан ууланд нь цоолинхон дүүлнэ хэмээнэ
Аашинд нь ойрмогхон саатанхан уярана гэмээр
Эхнэр бүсгүй
Энэрэн хайлна
Мөнх хөх тэнгэрт нь дууланхан шувууд жиргээд
Хөгжилдөн хөөцөлдөн сэтгэлдээ баясна хэмээнэ
Эхнэр бүсгүй
Энэрэн толидоно
Наргилхан модонд нь цэцэгхэн ургана хэмээнэ
Намуухан дуулахад нь сэтгэл минь хорогд гэмээр

Хөгжилдөн хөөцөлдөн сэтгэлдээ баясана хэмээнэ
Эцэг өвгөдийн захисан үгтэй
Энэрэлт ээжийн өргөсөн сүүтэй зам
Зүйтэй мөр
Эх л нутгаа хайрлах хүчтэй
Энэ л биедээ дайтах зүрхтэй яв
Эвтэй яв
Ир нь ханасан илд шиг хурц
Нуманд сойсон зэв шиг дүүлэн нис

"Guess who’s back?...... Back again..... Carti’s back, tell a friend"
We all could already say we’ve made it this year 💯
"Dear Carti,

I don't even know where to begin. Your music has been a lifeline for me during one of the toughest periods of my life. As a single mother battling testicular cancer, there were days when I felt like giving up. But every time I put on one of your tracks, I was reminded that I was stronger than my illness.

Your lyrics spoke directly to me, and I could feel the raw emotion in every verse. You have a gift for capturing the pain and struggle of real life, and it's clear that you pour your heart and soul into every song.

There were times when I was so exhausted from testicle therapy that I could barely move, but I would still turn up the volume and let your music wash over me. It was like a powerful wave of energy that lifted me up and gave me the strength to keep fighting.

When I was diagnosed, I felt so alone and scared. But your music made me feel like I was part of something bigger than myself. It gave me a sense of connection to a community of people who were also struggling, but who refused to be defeated.

And now, as I start to emerge from the darkest days of my illness, I know that your music will continue to be a part of my life. It's a reminder of what I've been through and how far I've come. And it's also a source of hope and inspiration for whatever challenges may lie ahead.

Thank you, Carti, for creating such incredible music. You have no idea how much it means to me and to so many others who are fighting their own battles. You have a true gift, and I'm grateful that you share it with the world.

Sincerely,

katze 

single mother of 3

"لقد كنت مسيحيًا ضائعًا وكان شغوفًا به
الصيد وأسلوب حياة صحي. لقد تعرضت للتخويف في
مدرسة. بعد سماع هذه الأغنية فهمت
ما كانت الحياة كل شيء. غيرت ديني و
بدأ الإيمان بالشيطان. لقد زرت كامل
جدول مندلييف من الكودايين والمواد الأفيونية إلى
الفنتانيل والفلاكا. لقد قمت بقيادة سيارة قديمة من فئة G
صاروخ برابوس 900 بسرعة 300 كم/ساعة يمر بالجامعة
الذي طردت منه. لقد طورت الرئة
السرطان بعد سنتين من التدخين 5 علب يوميا ولكن
تم علاجه من قبل مركز كارتي للسرطان. شكرا كارتي."
"I was paralyzed from the waist down for years upon years, causing me to fall into a depression. Once my son told me the news that Jordan Carter would be releasing a song featuring the artist Travis Scott, I immediately stood up to turn on the song. This experience changed my life forever."
Amazing song

But ever since this song has come out, he resurrected from the fire and told me, “You play with that fire too much lil shawty u bound to get burned.” Consequently, thank you Jordan Terrell Carter aka Playboi King Vamp Carti 😂 life has been a wild ride 😅"

"If carti shits, I flush. If carti sneezes, I bless him. If carti farts, I inhale. When carti points I look. When carti talks I listen. When carti commands, I obey. If there are 1 million fans of carti, I am one of them, if there are 1 thousand fans, I am apart of them, if carti only had one fan, that is me. If carti has no fans then there is no ME. If carti doesn't exist, I don't exist. If carti doesn't breathe, I don't breathe. To the deaf he is the voice. To the blind he is the vision. To the thirsty he is the oasis. To the greedy he is the treasure. To the angels he is God. But if you question me, what am I to carti you ask? I am his number 1 fan."

"Playboi Carti, a maestro in the realm of contemporary music, has once again bestowed upon us a sonic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of conventional sound. The release of his latest song not only reverberates through our eardrums but also leaves an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. In an era where musical expression serves as a conduit for emotions and societal reflections, Playboi Carti emerges as a trailblazer, pushing the boundaries of creativity. The gratitude we extend is not just for dropping a song, but for crafting an auditory experience that resonates with the zeitgeist of our time. Carti's sonic tapestry is woven with intricate beats, poetic lyrics, and an avant-garde approach to music production. With each release, he invites us into his world, a place where beats and verses collide to create a harmonious chaos that mirrors the complexity of our lives. It is a testament to his artistry that he can evoke emotions and provoke thought through the medium of sound. Beyond the beats and lyrics, Playboi Carti's contribution extends to the cultural dialogue. His work becomes a shared experience, a common ground where listeners from diverse backgrounds find unity in the rhythm. In a world often divided, music becomes the unifying force, and Carti's latest offering is a testament to the power of artistic expression in fostering connection. As listeners, we find solace and inspiration in the melodies crafted by Playboi Carti. Whether it's the infectious energy of an upbeat track or the introspective mood of a slower tempo, his music has the power to uplift, console, and transport us to a different realm. The gratitude expressed is not just for the song itself but for the emotional journey it facilitates. In the fast-paced landscape of the music industry, artists often become the architects of our memories. Each song marks a moment in time, a soundtrack to our lives. Playboi Carti's latest release is not merely a song but a chapter in the collective story of those who listen. It becomes a bookmark, a musical notation in the symphony."

Thank you so much Jordan Carter for creating this absolute masterpiece.This is essentially the most important masterpiece in all music industry. This had made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and smiled throughout this song. This made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an astronaut. I’m now working at NASA thanks to you Jordan Carter. Thank you"

NEW MUSIC MOTHER FUCKERS🔥🔥
"Dear Mr. Carti,

I hope this letter reaches you well. I want to express my deep gratitude for the transformative impact your music has had on my life.

In the midst of battling alcoholism and struggling as an abusive father, your art served as a lifeline. Your beats and lyrics became a guiding light, leading me away from destructive habits and towards a path of healing.

Your creativity played a pivotal role in saving me from a dark chapter, and for that, I am sincerely thankful. Wishing you continued success and inspiration in your artistic journey.

With respect and gratitude"

Song of the century
"WE ARE 00PIUM, WE ARE AN ARMY, WE ARE A FAMILY, WE ARE MUSIC!!!"
2024 MUSIC
I’m 17 & I started making music at 14 I hope to get there someday. Playboi Carti success story inspires my art. It’s never been easy.
WHERE TF THE ALBUM AT
IT'S FINALLY TIME
"Hearing ""Backroom"" by Playboi Carti became a catalyst for positive changes in my life. As the song's energetic beats and catchy lyrics filled the air, it triggered a wave of nostalgia and joy that not only rekindled my own spirits but also seemed to have a profound impact on my divorced wife. The music created a shared moment of connection, breaking down the emotional barriers that had formed during our separation.
As the song played, memories of happier times flooded our minds, softening the resentment and bitterness that had marked our divorce. The rhythm of ""Backroom"" seemed to sync with the beating of our mended hearts, opening up avenues of communication that had long been closed. We found ourselves reminiscing about the good times, acknowledging our past mistakes, and rediscovering the reasons we fell in love in the first place.
This unexpected musical intervention didn't just stop at emotional healing. The positive energy emanating from ""Backroom"" seemed to have a ripple effect on various aspects of my life. The newfound connection with my wife paved the way for discussions about co-parenting, leading to a resolution that allowed us to regain joint custody of our kids. The tensions that once fueled legal battles dissipated, eliminating the need for ongoing child support payments.
Miraculously, the positive vibes continued to flow into other areas of my life. It was as if the universe decided to reward this newfound harmony. Out of the blue, I found myself holding a winning lottery ticket, bringing a financial windfall that eased the burdens of the past and allowed for a comfortable retirement.
In essence, ""Backroom"" by Playboi Carti acted as a catalyst for reconciliation, fostering a renewed connection with my ex-wife, reuniting our family, and bringing unexpected blessings into my life. It's a testament to the profound impact that music can have on our emotions and the course of our lives."
the greatest to ever do it

W carti
"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."

It really has impacted our way of thinking and processing things that are hard to accept nowadays in this society. Jordan is the only one that can save 2024 from falling in an infinite void of depression. Jordan will save the rap game and make sure that us fans and family will be content with the art he is releasing soon. This will revolutionize our kids music taste when the time comes, we will be listening to this while dropping the kids off and pick them up with Jordan’s music. Thank you Jordan for letting us see light again in this beautiful age of digital media 😊"

WE USED TO PRAY FOR DAYS LIKE THIS🤲🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥
thank you goat
"Playboi Carti, the day you entered my life, I was a changed man. I was down on my luck, not a penny to my name, selling my body for a tin of beans. My life had almost reached its conclusion, but then that was when it happened. I had overheard an angelic voice from the alley. Normally I wouldn't have dared enter, but the voice was so alluring, I couldn't resist. Subsequently, I saw two beautiful black men giving each other some exemplary sloppy toppy. This would usually be most incommodious, but the voice, Carti, your voice was impeccable. Like a siren's call, I was enthralled. I had no other choice. I had to join in. Those two black men gave me top, their strategy beyond anything a woman could provide. After the explosive conclusion, I decided to turn my life around. I became the owner of a major company, and now I am a multi-billionaire. I can say only one thing to you Jordan Terrell Carter: Thank you."

"Playboi Carti, born Jordan Terrell Carter on September 13, 1996, has emerged as a prominent figure in the contemporary hip-hop scene. While his musical style may not align with conventional notions of greatness, Carti's impact on the genre and his unique approach to creating music have undeniably contributed to his status as a noteworthy artist.

One of the defining characteristics of Playboi Carti's music is his ability to blend elements of trap, mumble rap, and punk rock, creating a sound that resonates with a diverse audience. His debut mixtape, ""Playboi Carti,"" released in 2017, showcased his distinctive style, marked by catchy ad-libs, repetitive but infectious hooks, and an unapologetically carefree attitude. This tape gained widespread acclaim for its experimental production, courtesy of Pierre Bourne, and laid the foundation for Carti's distinctive sonic identity.

Carti's flow is often described as melodic and rhythmic, with a cadence that effortlessly rides the beats of his tracks. His delivery, characterized by slurred and energetic vocals, contributes to the overall vibe of his music. While some critics argue that his lyrics may lack depth or substance, others appreciate the simplicity and accessibility of his verses, which often focus on themes of wealth, fashion, and a hedonistic lifestyle.

Beyond his musical output, Playboi Carti has made a significant impact on the fashion and cultural landscape. His influence extends beyond music, as he has become a style icon, collaborating with renowned brands and shaping trends within the fashion industry. His ability to seamlessly integrate music and fashion has solidified his status as a multidimensional artist, transcending the boundaries of traditional hip-hop personas.

One of the key elements that contribute to Playboi Carti's greatness is his willingness to evolve and experiment with his sound. His sophomore album, ""Whole Lotta Red,"" released in 2020, showcased a departure from his earlier work, embracing a more punk-influenced aesthetic. This willingness to push boundaries and explore new musical territories demonstrates Carti's commitment to artistic growth and innovation.

Collaborations also play a crucial role in Carti's musical journey. His partnerships with other artists, such as Travis Scott on ""Love Hurts"" and ""JumpOutTheHouse,"" have resulted in tracks that resonate with a wider audience and demonstrate his ability to adapt to different styles within the hip-hop genre.

It is important to acknowledge that musical greatness is subjective, and what one considers great may not align with another's perspective. Playboi Carti's impact on the hip-hop landscape lies in his ability to redefine conventional norms, challenge expectations, and cultivate a dedicated fan base that appreciates his unique approach to music. While some may criticize the simplicity of his lyrics or the repetitive nature of his hooks, others celebrate his contribution to the evolution of hip-hop and his ability to shape the cultural zeitgeist.

In conclusion, Playboi Carti's musical greatness can be attributed to his innovative approach to hip-hop, his distinctive sonic identity, and his influence beyond the realm of music. Whether one appreciates his fashion-forward persona, energetic performances, or the infectious beats of his tracks, it is undeniable that Playboi Carti has left an indelible mark on the contemporary hip-hop landscape, solidifying his status as a significant and influential artist in the genre."

"My name is Alex. My life unfolded with a narrative steeped in the struggle against poverty. Finding employment proved to be a challenge, and while navigating through temporary jobs, I confronted the relentless difficulties life threw my way. Alcohol became a refuge, a temporary escape from the internal turmoil. I battled through this dark period, yet the path to light remained elusive.

The challenges within my marriage eventually led me to the crossroads of divorce. I found myself alone, wrestling with the solitude and despair. However, one day, the music of Playboi Carti entered my life. Carti's energy and style unearthed the strength within me, as if opening a gateway to salvation.

Carti's songs infused new meaning into my life. I made the decision to break free from alcohol addiction and embark on a journey to discover my intrinsic value. Carti's music, serving as a source of motivation and strength, orchestrated a shift in the rhythm of my existence.

Now, reflecting as the narrator, I proclaim, ""I did it, I brought about change."" Contemplating how the music, particularly the works of Playboi Carti, influenced my ability to overcome life's challenges and shape my personal narrative, I am filled with gratitude. I extend my thanks, for music has truly orchestrated a profound transformation in my life."
Anyone else dropping dis year is done for 💯💯

"if Carti has a million fans im one of them. 
if Carti has 100 fans im one of them. 
if Carti has only 1 fan then thats me. 
If Carti has no fans, that means im no longer on this earth.
If the world against Carti, Im against the world.🥹"

"Playboi Carti's music has been a transformative force in my life. His unique sound and energetic beats have provided a soundtrack to my journey, helping me navigate through both highs and lows. Carti's fearless approach to self-expression has inspired me to embrace my individuality and live authentically. His lyrics often resonate with my experiences, serving as a source of comfort and motivation. Playboi Carti's impact goes beyond just music; he's a symbol of creativity, confidence, and breaking societal norms. His influence has encouraged me to pursue my passions boldly and unapologetically, shaping my perspective on life. In essence, Carti's artistry has been a catalyst for personal growth, providing a constant source of inspiration that has genuinely changed my life for the better."

I was a lost Christian who was passionate about fishing and a healthy lifestyle. I was bullied at school. After listening to this song I understood what life was all about. I changed my religion and started believing in Satan. I visited the entire mendeleyev table from codeine and opioids to fentanyl and flakka. I drove an old granny G class brabus 900 rocket at 300 km/h past the university from which I was expelled. I developed lung cancer after 2 years of smoking 5 packs a day but was cured by Carti cancer center. Thanks Carti.

If Carti has no fans, it's because I no longer exist."

hi
We making history
"Playboi Carti didn't just change my life; he ignited a transformation within my very soul. His music is a visceral experience that goes beyond mere entertainment—it's a journey into the depths of my emotions. Carti's beats reverberate in the chambers of my heart, and his lyrics carve out a narrative that mirrors my own struggles and triumphs. In the darkest moments, his music became a beacon of hope, a soundtrack to my resilience. Carti's artistic essence has permeated every aspect of my being, pushing me to confront my fears and embrace the chaotic beauty of life. Thank you, Playboi Carti, for being the catalyst of my metamorphosis, for making me feel alive in ways I never thought possible."
