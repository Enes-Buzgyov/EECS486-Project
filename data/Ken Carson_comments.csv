not a single phone in sight
name of first song?
What song 4:57 ?
1:04:50 братики дурачатся
best
Damm
"i fucking love opium so much man i wish ken and all these guys would go harder when they perform this is no disrespect at all, i just wanna see ken spit a song word for word + do actual vocals  , i rly think it would get these crowds on a whole diff level"
Crowd is so weak… put your phone down and fucking mosh
"WTF is going on? Fighting my Demon is one of the best songs in 2023 and Ken Carson dont rave to it? You can clearly see that the audience is slowing down cause he is not hyping them up. This could be greater then a Travis Scott live performance, but i think they where to stoned to realise. They missed it but still great songs"
why the secuirty guard on stage so mad and saf 😭
carti didnt scream the first time live
crowd was so ass
the world need a carti and ken collab album to heal🧛🏻🦇
Poop
timelaps of intro songs ?
"Ken album so amazing, top to bottom (pause) . Also Carti with his back to the crowd most the time is hilarious to me."
Ken sounds like Playboi Carti on the stage
Amazing. But he needs to really rage to get the crowd into it more
"Whats the yung nudy song😭😭 

Nvm found it, if any1 wants to know it's slight dub by baby drill and yung nudy"
Dear Opium Community With this message Im confessing that Im new gen….Im Sorry to everybody
Bottom middle of the crowd was so td I fw them 😂😂😂🖤

Wish Ken would try more during his live performances. When he doesn’t try it makes the crowd dead
is carti gon let ken perform his album? 😭
Lone ruined tf out thr concert when he came out for Singapore the ehole energy went down 😂😂
That's amazing! Let's stay in touch.
Неплохой разогрев перед выступлением карти
Luv you Ken 🖤
"I’m not gonna lie I don’t know how to feel for this shit cause my emotions is everywhere. Honestly, when carti  came out, these motherfuckers should a tore  up the whole room. busy worried about recording and not getting lit. Imagine seeing Cardi out there and everybody is standing around with their phones just out recording him. Nobody’s dancing everybody standing still in a crowd. Damn you’re halfway moving.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
😮
Did anybody ask Carti when he will drop?
That’s superb! Let’s connect?
"Thank you ken so much. I had a disease in my ears, my family was suffering, and my dog had cancer. After hearing this majestic and gorgeous album all my diseases are cured and can even hear colors. I started my own company and am on track to soon have my pants falling from all these racks in my broches. Thanks you again for your blessings and your potential to cure all my problems. I will never forget you and will always carry you in my heart till my last day comes. Thank you🥲"
Carti at 47:40

Bro deconstructing rage performance to the bare minimum. People too outdated to understand this new style.
"Ngl bro. Looks like the people who went paid money to see these dudes smoke blunts and chill most of the show. I’d be pretty blown, but I guess that’s expected when carti is there."
Most able Ken Carson fans:
I will never forget him playing succubus the first time
Music for white people
Historic
That’s brilliant! Let’s stay in touch :)
bro's album presentation starts with other artist's song
Yo
I thought I was listening to itsokaytocry but this is sick regardless.
Yo mfs so wack this why Travis throw the phones bc why tf are you recording the whole fucking performance get fucking littttt
I bet Nobody gets the d wade bar 😢 damn he violated carti
4:43
Who else clucked off before carti came out ffs
weakass pit god damn
What's the intro song?
Yuh
This album is hella good and Carti is hella smart with what he's doing with Opium. I really fuck with it and its gonna leave a mark for this generation.
ken was high asf 😂😂13:39
Yeaaaa
42:00 DJ Carson
A Beautiful Chaos “ABC” 🧛🏿
Greatest concert of all time
song at 4:38 ?
"damn, the thumbnail lookin like carti ngl"
Every one recording the whole show makes me questioning why they even went there.
bro why they turnin their backs to the crowd like that?

Damn why F1thy built like biggie cheese
This album might be better than Yeat’s breakout album “Up 2 Me”
These concerts would be way better if people actually went there to enjoy the music.
Some meat riders dawg who tf would pay to watch this shit
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I love this Album, thank you Ken!!"
Nahh where’s like this ?
FUCK

Kenny san🥰
can’t believe carti decided to visit his children
The Concert goers POV from their phone cameras better than this stream fr. Feels like Opium members don’t know how to properly film things at good angles.
chłop co ukradł pomysł od imperatora z Głubczyc
Nice to see carti still showing to the lil shows (: I hate the festival sh*t
i’m just fighting my demons
