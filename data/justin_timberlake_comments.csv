"By way of Tennessee, you're welcome for Timberlake, Miley, and Swift"
"Simply The Best!
Welcome back JT"
This is such a beautiful song and he sings it beautifully 😊💕💕
I love Justin I just.dont get why the people moving things in the video.
The beginning of this song reminded me of Ariana Grande's song.
"Just dropped my cover of Selfish on my channel, it would make my day if you gave it a listen! 🙌🏻❤
Thanks!

Phill Mac."
My favourite song of all time ❤
he sings so well live!
I Of A Kind  You Remind  Me of My Uncle  Your  style ✌️ ☮️ 🕊
I gave my Justin doll to my niece. I adore Justin!
"Удовольствие для ушей и глаз! 
Все со вкусом и очень чувственно!❤
Браво 👏👏👏"
This song expressed how I feel for my wonderful fiance. I love him more than anything and would do almost anything for him. He's my angel.
"Better than Sex❤😂❤
Or makes you want to have that love.  Such a high level performance......the outfit...the choreography....the live of such greatness!
It waslike ketchup drip the anticipation to see you dance again.  No one better to reveal this class act the G Horton❤❤❤"
"Love this one for your boo, JT! 💞"

"I missed Justin. I'm glad his still making music. That performance, though, he just made a music video on a talk show 😮"
About time Mr Timberlake! ...And what a treat this song is... ❤❤❤
You need to calm down lol 😆 I know
This sounds like  something justin beiber would sing
His voice is still perfection 💕
"Give this man his flowers already,his vocals are unstoppable,natural and flawless,ever since hearing ""Its gonna be me"" i knew that this dude was something different and just stood out,such a unique sound to his voice,and we all know he can move/dance"
I've watched this many times since it's come out...he absolutely crushed this performance.
Why are they repossessing his stuff?
😮‍💨
"Круто!!! Тот же голос как раньше, та же пластика и внешне не изменился..."
🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶our JT
Dios mio me encanta es toda perfección 😅❤
"Love Justin! I also love his new album! I also must point out that his new wardrobe style…wide leg trousers, Chanel, pearls….remind you of anyone else? My MAIN man Harry Styles!!! 😊 when two of my loves collide it makes me happy ❤❤❤❤"
Джастин с огромным уважением❤. Простой Русский парень. 😊 Твори далее. !!!!

If you don’t release a new music over 6 years you need to consider that world will forget about you .Wait was too long .Mistake! Justin is doing very poorly with his new Album

"Making Memphis proud 🦚, the timeless funk of Justin Timberlake 💓 addictives have been added to sound"
"Okay this was incredible, his snl performance was horrible. He would have performed like this on more live shows and the song would have been a hit . It peaked at 19, should have been higher"
Wow. Incredible live performance.
Seamlessly and methodically executed an great artistic vision!
❤
"Voice looks like Juntin Bieber ,,,wonderful song ❤❤"

"Not a Fan of Justin Timberlake, mainly because he is. CULTURE VULTURE dealing with Black Americans Culture ‼️
 The situation that happened to Janet Jackson & Brittany Spears was SA‼️‼️‼️
Justin Timberlake can Kick 🦵🏿 ROCKS 🪨🤪🤬🙄🫨🤥😡🤯😱😜"
Justin
"Fortunately, we had spare props when the studio next door needed these props urgently."
Wow ❤
"a brilliant performance; and i’m guessing the dropping of the curtain was actually electronically connected and synched to the specific notes/beats of the music, that’s why it dropped with such precision, matching seamlessly with Justin’s sitting down."
Love this song
"Greetings from Croatia! This is amazing, all synchronized (like nsync :-) <3"
That was a live music video for sho! Just Brilliant! 👏🏾👏🏾 Nobody does it like JT! 💯👏🏾

Woh! Genius performance

The best live performance i ever seen in my life..Love you JT

This should be the video for this song.  Absolutely amazing!
This performance was Grammy worthy good
"Even better than the Album version. So classy, so much style. A more beautiful rendition of an already great song."
Great song 😊
I thought he has already retired.
This reminded me of when Ashton Kutcher punk’d him and took all his belongings…only difference is Justin wasn’t singing and dancing on that lol 😅
"that was pretty smooth! Also, this reminds me of when I got evicted from my apartment while singing karaoke"
Perfect performance❤
Praise the cameraman big time
"I love this song ,it feels relaxing.👍😊👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌟💫⭐️"
Brasil ama você 😊😊😊

Great song! This gives me late 90's Boyz II Men vibes
"This selfish Sson of a gun only just did a live set video better than the Official video. 
Hahahahaha the brass on this guy."

"Ай, молодец!"

Love this song ❤
Wow amazing
ugh
This performance sucked
This song is on my Spotify playlist the moment I heard it the first time ❤
Mariah's version is better🎉❤
"Do Drown instead Justin, let the DJ fix the end of the song, it's a banger."
Hammer❤
Great gig but the marks his white sneakers left on the floor were awful. IMHO an extra 20 seconds and a decent mop would make it a hit.
Damn he’s old now 😂🔥
This performance musicality I love so much the live band brings out so much ❤
Hey Justin. Omg
"Well, in this song, I do not hear Justin Timberlake instead I hear usher, and Justin Bieber."
Wow!!!!!❤
"His work ethic at this stage of his career is amazing.  To go to the trouble of choreographing a music video, rehearsing it, and pulling it off without a hitch live, when he could have just phoned it in singing at the mike, shows why he deserves all his success since his Mickey Mouse Club days."
❤❤❤
아진짜세상에서혼자멋있네 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
DAT PERFORMANCE ! HOLY BROOOO !! YOUR HAVE BEEN  WAY TOOO LONG AWAY FROM  US :D
#JUSTIN DO YOU PLAY FORTNITE?

He still makes me as giddy as he did when I was a teenager rushing home to watch NSYNC vids on TRL. I'm almost 42 and known by anyone in my orbit as an official JT fanatic. He is just on another level and this creative set design/performance makes me so amped to be 5th row at his upcoming tour!! ❤❤❤
I love this song. What a great comeback!
This song hits different when you're driving home after work.💯😎🔥 Thank you Justin.
"Wow how good is JT, managed to make that live performance look like a music vid. Awesome job Justin, truly talented"
Is it me or is the audio and video not synched
He just keeps looking better and better

"Uh
If they saw what I saw
They would fall the way I fell
But they don't know what you want
And baby, I would never tell
If they knew what I know
They would never let you go
So guess what?
I ain't ever lettin' you go
'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time
So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel
Every time the phone rings
I hope that it's you on the other side
I wanna tell you everything ('thing)
Everything that's on my mind
And I don't want any other guys
Takin' my place, girl, I got too much pride
I know I may be wrong
But I don't wanna be right
'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time, uh
So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel
Owner of my heart
Tattooed your mark (tattooed your)
There for the whole world to see
You're the owner of my heart
And all my scars
Baby, you got such a hold on me, so
So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish (guess I'm selfish)
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no

"i guess im ""shellfish"" lol"
"Love ❤️ this song 🎶, love 💕 his voice"
Hope ur career can  fly again after Britney and Janet revelations…
esse cara é  fora de serie! ele lança um album a cada 10 anos e vem com uma bomba dessa ...meu cantor favorito...
"This song is amazing and beautyfull ✨ touch my hearth, several yimes no find the words and J.T makr it possible, SONG 100% dedicated song for a special person ✨✨💓💓"
just amazing! 🥰
Omg such amazing decorations in live concert 😊 extraordinarily Justin _legend never be forgotten even after 6 years of silence
Love the theatricals. Very unique and innovative. Clever! 🔥
I love this song. He always sound great 👍❤
❤❤
Stunning! Wow ❤
JT is a baby killer. What he did to Britney Spears when she was 19 years old was pretty disgusting. I threw all his CD away. He needs to publicly apologize to Britney Spears because she deserves it.
Is he aware some guys just stole his room? 😂
He sounds so nasally...ewe.
JT is back y'all 🔥
"Damn!!! Britney's book ""That Man!"" Watching this ""THAT MAN!!"""
Sounds whiny
This curtain fall...wow. So perfectly timed. Loved it.
Love listening to this song on  long drive.
I wanna hear jc sing this song
This guy is an absolute genius!
"This is art. It felt like we were watching a music video but it was a live performance with an amazing concept, amazing crew, cameraman, lighting, vocals, song, and those curtains coming down in the end - wow, perfection! ❤"
Why did he delete his SNL performance of Selfish?
Justin Timberlake & The Bailiffs
"Que apresentação FODA, principalmente esse final 😮 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
Great setting! The song is weak for a comeback!
Buenísimo Performance
Perfection! ❤
J'adore trop smooth. Avec l'orchestre symphonique  juste wouahh. A écouter en boucle❤❤❤
What's going on at 3:24? Wrong note on the bass?
This is Art ! The creative directory is amazing 👏
this was way better then the snl performance !! so good
😍😍😍😍
When you don’t pay your Aaron’s Rent to Own bill.. lol
❤
I love him.
Sick... 🎉
"WTF, this is a really showman"
"Uh

If they saw what I saw
They would fall the way I fell
But they don't know what you want
And baby, I would never tell

Unreal!
Glides through that with zero effort. Very smooth👌
"This performance is just brilliant. So minimalistic, but so nicely done! 🤩"
Some kind of kpop camera work done here. First time to western artist perform like this. Love ittt!
"It reminds me... Working my ass off, when the boss is around"
"❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤"
this song is so smooth to the vocals. I was hoping they left the plants at least.
Such a good song to come back with.
this is great but i still prefer the Mariah Carey version 🤷🏽‍♂️
Damn. This is a wow
I think this just became my favorite JT song of all time
I love your voice...so much 😊
Great came back
UGHH I LOVE IT
Awesome performance! JT the best yet! Congratulations from Memphis!
"Saludos Justin,❤"
"Su voz tiene poca presencia,  utiliza demasiadas capas vocales atrás.  Es mejor el cover AI de Mariah Carey."
"This was magic. I love seeing anything Justin does, but this was special. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
Os caras não brinca na produção!
"even though im to poor to see this LIve Im so thankful for this share. Pure excellent, belief in love. Care to craft."
J adoreeeeeee❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The cameraman needs ALL the shine for this performance. ❤
This is not good. At all.
That was a super dope performance! Damn! Love the vision & execution.
I love this song and that performance was deeply beautiful.. Like magic.
Sick. SICK❤
Feels like good old times seeing Justin perform and sing again. ❤
Tune 🔥
So smoooth and calm voice 🥰😍😊
Tu as trop la classe je surkif 💞
Sounds even better in here!!! ❤😍
Amazing song! But after reading Britney’s book I’ll never look at him the same 🤷🏽‍♀️
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
He’s bringing back the late 90’s /2000’s and I’m definitely for it !!!
I think he was phenomenal! He sounds great every time I hear him sing it!
"Stop making JT happen, it’s not gonna happen"
turning on the little light lol
His voice is so pretty
Amooo adoro suas músicas um cantor excelente ❤️🥰🫶😘🇧🇷
Justin your amazing keep that beautiful music coming love you 🖤🌹
"MEU DEUS, MUITO LINDO! MUITO TALENTOSO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH"
Artistic Genius!
Does anyone knows what shoes he is wearing? Thank you
Is this his answer to Britney's Everytime?
Friggen amazing boy.  🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
The live version is so much better than the studio version. That's what a true artist does. Love it
I really like this song. I listen to it over and over again and I like it more and more. Gives me strength to continue. Thanks! GREAT ARTIST ... Always Justin Timberlake!
Loved the song and video. ❤❤

Great performance dude ... amazing ..
The backup dancers are really minding their OWN business 😂😂
"Супер песня, и как всегда стильный Джастин!"
🤍
that was so distracting and then 'the end'. Take a bow!
https://www.youtube.com/@nathyofficielJ1402/?sub_confirmation=1❤❤
i imagine branch singing this to poppy 😭🙏
Lol he sounded like a cartoon when he started singing i almost didn’t think this was real
There goes my inner 90s girl heart all over ❤ Just love JT
So glad this single is more popular and well received more than than any single from his last album. Other than say something the last album was hated lol.
Please perform in Malaysia ..we've waited for so long
Please perform in Malaysia ..we've waited for so long
10 Grammys. That’s great. Love his music 🎵 too
"One thing about JT, he’s gonna perform."
Bro I can't stop the feeling #visitRwanda
Monstro! 😍
This is too damn good JT!! So smooth! So excited you are back sharing your amazing talent with us!
Anyone know what these sneakers are?
I love that performance. Perfect 🤩 👏🏾
He may good but he is not such a good person he got something at the cost of other people Janet Jackson Britney spears and others should we forget that fact
He needs new dance moves. He was more diverse with nsync and his fist 2 solo albums.
"Bad outfit!!! 
Looks like something Kim Jong would wear"
Finally he’s back!❤❤❤
"His voice, pitch and delivery blow me away every time 🔥🔥🔥"
What a song!
Good for Justin for picking up lauv Paris in the rain brand and running with it. Lauv RIP DOG YOU FUCKED UP NOT RUNNING WITH THAT
"Justin, Deine Stimme ist göttlich schön❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹👍👍👍👍🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️👏👏👏👏👏"
Grammy award 2024 song of the year
"Music great, performance for me very Cheesy 😮"
Timber Just In Lake :D :)
They just wanted to save time on breaking down the set!
I swear that sounds like NSync band mates doing background vocals
Please Justin..No Stop 🛑
His smile in the end... awwww gotta love JT
Gooood
Mmm....the pant style! 😍 Love this song
"КРАСАВЧИК!!
Стиль,голос,пластика)))
👍👍👍👍👍"
❤
Perfection 👌
Hope you visit europe with your new music 🫶🏽
"Que performace incrível. JT é brilhante, embora nos tempos de N sync o Jc tinha a voz melhor. O talento a criatividade de Justin prevalecia. Eu sabia que ele conseguria carreira solo. Coisa que Jc nao conseguu 🎉"
His outfit is horrible!
Wooow what a tv performance
Oh real music thank goodness
"W. O. W! Obsessed for so many reasons! 👏🏼 Wtg, JT!!! 💞🎶"
That was hot
Welcome back Justin♥
Lindo e talentoso
JUSTICE FOR BRITNEY
Love how this was shot!!
hes soo amazing and hes from my hometown of memphis!!!
My friend Nimmz did a great job of removing the furniture. No wonder he's been so busy haha.
Supercool
I didn’t think it was possible to be even more obsessed with JT than I already have been for years and years but yep! It’s happening! He looks and sounds absolutely amazing and I’m so here for his return!!! ❤🎉
This is fucking garbage.
❤❤❤
I guess I’m selfish ❤️❤️💙💙🎼🎵🎶
Perfection
Awesome love it and cool
You all know that he had bad flu while was shot this program and he delivered. WOOOW Smooth performance😮❤ that coordination of extras and JT was suberb choreographed. BRAVO🎉
Now THIS is a performance!!!
"I don't get it.

Also, why did it come across like he was lip-syncing? That didn't sound live at all.

NGL I'd rather watch Janet Jackson."
"O M G = #Beyond 💫 Brilliant 🧠

#JustinTimberlake YOU inspire ME #homie 🤙🏽
#GrahamNorton YOU are a True Evening 🦉#Legend 

🤟🏽

💠
LE"
Can’t wait to see him on tour!! ❤️
Класс! Прям послевкусие от его работы)) Джастин молодец 👍
I got tickets to see his concert 3 times this tour. I can’t wait to see the whole show.
"Me pergunto onde estão os fãs dele permitindo com que ele tenha um desempenho tão fraco nas paradas de Música, essa obra merece mais reconhecimento."
"He' talented af, how the hell this looks like a music video, amazing job 👏"
Not better like Michael Jackson
Class. JT never misses.
I’m jealous & selfish unfortunately
"Bro that was amazing!  So glad your back.  So special,  love you man."
"Love You, but its sounds like karaoke in the morning"
Brilliant❤
"That was musical, choreographed, and cinematic perfection. Wow, just wow. Welcome back, JT!"
The amount of effort put into the preparation for this performance is amazing. JT is such a top class professional in his game. We are in for a treat when his album comes out!
The GOAT 🐐
😍😍😍
"W.O.W!!!!!!!! That curtain drop!!!!! So classy, amazing, spectacular!"
"Please dance, always dance, never stop dancing. Please, Justin."
So terrible 😢 really generic and lazy music. I was really hoping for something original
"One can love Justin AND Britney at the same time. 
They were kids when they were together. Pop stars controlled by their management teams. 
Did he force her to get an abortion, no. Was it awful that he asked her…no…unfortunate that that all happened though, yes. 
I love them both and I’m it ashamed to say so."
"Performance flawless, cinematic flawless, production flawless!  JT is pop king!"
カッコイイ曲♡そしてどんどん片付けられていくのね♡おもしろい！
Boo!!!!
Konsepnya sekalian beresin ye bang
I used these guys to move house once … took ages! ❤
"Wow, this Was perfect , just like a music vid.
Simply brilliant."
Meh

"PEOPLE NEVER GET BORED AND TIRED OF TOUR VOICE SONGS
WHERE THE HELL GAVE YOU BEEN
PEOPLE ARE BORED AND TIRED OF DUA LIPA AND HER SONGS AND VOICE"
"AMAZING
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN JUSTIN
PLEASE BACK TO.MUSIC"
Such a cool jam. People keep saying he looks haggard. Like hello we’re all aging and he looks great.
"Yeah, his voice sounded like a cartoon character when he wasn’t singing to his background vocals. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
the best!!!!!! love you justin😍
This dude is 40 somthing... singing songs like he's a teenager.... can we get some grown up music or nah?
JT getting evicted on TV.
hoping new album is good because the last one was horrible big flop
❤❤❤❤
Extraordinary 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"WOW.
WOW JT."
There is something magical about him
"JT sit down, ssssh and then go away."
I love that the authentic artists sounds unique and not like anybody else
"So well done, just so skilful and so damn fantastic."
ESPECTÁCULO PURO

The King ! Love this Song ❤
This was fantastic. Happy to see Justin in his element.
"Love my glowing heart, Justin, forever shining ✨️ 💛 ❤💯🙏👏"
The yellow curtain falls down at the end is a sick concept 🫶🏼
"Wasn’t going to enjoy it, but I did 😁"
Absolutely fantastic!!!! ❤ 🔥
"What's with this chipmunks voice at the beginning? 🤔
Anyways, love him 🫶🔥🔥🔥"
JT bringing back the baggy jeans outfit. Definitely a true 90s and early 2000s trend.
"this was so lovely, I think I stopped breathing for a second ever so entertaining 💗"
"I don't think he's performed this song the same way twice, and I absolutely love it"
Non mo stancherò mai di dire che adoro questa canzone e sopratutto lui
Beautiful music. Greatful to have his music in my life
Selfish 🤔 But Perfect 👌 😃 🤩 🙌
Someone tell me the shirt he’s wearing please?! 👌
Justin is back! 🤩❤
A true pro.. 👊✌️
"Justin sempre incrível desde pequena sou tua fã,  amo teu trabalho. Força e parabéns mais uma vez. De Moçambique, África ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉"

"Props to this legend, I met a girl and this is our song, thank you Justin, beautiful song. I feel just like the lyrics of the song about her."
Beautiful ❤️🩷🥰👍

Literally another music video for SELFISH
Chills! Always amazing JT
The fact that he’s doing this while getting flu is crazy 🙌🏽
Great performance. Addicted to this song already!
Amazing!
Good performance. I’d like more dancing
Simply love it ❤!
❤❤❤
💛💛💛💛💛
🙂😍❤
Amazing!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"This is not just a few songs on a new album scheduled to release.  Justin and his team put together a whole damn package of entertainment across multiple mediums for us to consume.  Brilliant.
The songs I've heard so far have some of the best writing/producing I've heard in a long time."
What’s amazing is that the movers took 4 minutes to move everything! And moving with style as well.
"Justin, I wonder were you Bach, Mozart, maybe Vivaldi? What's my favourite? Vivaldi..."
Now..youre my favorite JT! ❤❤❤
A M A Z I N G🎉❤ I hope you get better really soon 🙏💕
By far my favorite 😘😇
Another creative performance 👏 love this song it's always stuck in my head
好き！素敵！！
Love the Song!❤
The poor audio mix fucked this great live performance
Stunning as always! See you 7th Aug at Birmingham arena!!!!! ❤🎉
❤❤❤❤
Magnifique !!! J’attendais depuis longtemps un autre album !!! Je ne suis pas déçue !!! 🧡💜🧡
Great performance.  What a show ✌️
Is anyone else thinking WTF is up with the clothes?  I can't believe the baggy style of the 90s is coming back. It was so ugly back then and it's even uglier now.
Mesmo gripado o homem entrega um som de qualidade
So good
One of the BEST
That was amazing and it is so beautiful to see how much you mean each word you sing. ❤
Why don't you and your wife talk about what is happening in Gaza?
This.
Best performance I’ve ever seen on Graham Norton!
The lows were super smooth today 👌
JT is back! You cannot cancel a man of this calibre!!
It's about time to get some good music... i just can't stop listening to this ever since it got released.
thought i was watching a music video
This was sooooo good!
"Ну пой свою песню, зачем в который раз оскорблять  Бритни Спирс ?! Ты хотел популярности? Ты получил ее засчет хейта и ненависти к Бритни! Спустя столько лет как был мразью так и остался."
??? Anscheinend finde nur ich das Lied mega langweilig 😅
Perfect ❤
i love you Justin
Very Clean and Cinematic...owesome performance from the PRINCE OF POP 👑 JT
Love!!!
WOW !!!!
Change stylist!
Welcome back🙌 I've waited (and I guess many others waited too) so long for you to release new music 🫶🎶
He sounds so young because hes sick...
Fantastic performer❤
"Note perfect even with illness, inch perfect with every step of the performance, so polished and smooth it's what every performer dreams of."
Que lindo ❤
❤
"He is a good singer, but massively insecure and such a shame he treated women so badly. He always had a huge streak of vanity to his personality. Who remembers when he loved being called trouser snake - that nickname didn't age well.. 🙈"
I love this music ♥️ 🎶 🎵 ❤️ 😌 and I love you Justin Timberlake in my heart forever ♥️ 🎵 ❤️ 💖 💓 💗 ♥️ 🎵 ❤️ 💖 💓 💗 ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊
😲😲😲😲😲😲✨✨✨
❤ SO flipping excellent
Life❤
In awe of him. My heart can't take it .the way he delivered this performance is everything ♥
the fact that he was sick and singing this way .this man is everything❤. ily JT. He and his music will always be my safe space. Only have love for him.
3:52 was just too good 🤌
My early childhood heart is rejoicing!
epic
👀
🙏
I love this ❤
В начале чё за жесть 😂
This was SO good. aww man please reschedule Roundhouse in London! we were so happy to get tix!
I LOVE! I LOVE! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
How does he sing like that while sick how 🤯❤️
Like l vove you
"stunning song, amazing performance!!"
WOW ....he didn't just perform the song very well ...but he also literally made A SECOND CLIP to the song ! ....AMAZING !
"Great song but this concept didn't make sense at all, singing meanwhile i hired some movers to help me clean this stage"
Voice of Justin naturally deep. But I like his vocal.
His song is great.
Mesmerising 😊. Such vocal and movement talent and completely original. How I would have loved to have been there 😍
Damn Justin 🔥
"I love the metaphor here, as everything has been taken away from him, little by little, he can no longer communicate (the red phone) and he is left alone in the dark. And this could then be connected to Drown, the new song."
JT is amazing hands down
3:29 ON REPEAT. Gd those harmonies
❤❤❤❤🇵🇱
Keren parah JT...gila...gila....
Justin ruined the Norton's floor with his marks ))))))))
Waah❤❤
Amazing! Hope he recovers from the flu soon!
"Pure style and so smooth ,fantastic performance ❤"
this version took me to church!!!!.... come on somebody!!!🙌👏... tears shed... grateful heart.  Thanks for the music JT!
some one get that man drunk and stoned need more dance music
❤
Yeeees! 💫 👏🏻
"MF is sick and still didnt miss a note, great job from the background singers that had his back in some notes that were more difficult for him to sing, thats brilliant 👏👏"
Oh my god!! What a performance and when he's not feeling great! The dedication to his art and his fans! Wow!! Heal up JT! We want you better!
"Love this song. However I love the album version the most. I think it would work even better live if they were going in a completely different direction with it. Maybe even more subtle and acoustic. The extra drumming, overpowering background vocals and etc seems a bit overkill to me. At least for this song. The emotion gets buried in flashy fills."
The curtain drop was unexpected. Truly creative and artistic.
"I wonder if Justin is a fan of The 1975 as this staging is very similar to their current tour. Great performance of this song. The first outing of this song before it was released felt very flat, but with the added production and vocals, it sounds great now!"
So happy this talented man has returned to music ❤
The ending is so amazing 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song is really growing on me🥲
Great live performance by Justin! The staging concept was cool!
Perfection
He is the best🫡
Cinematic😍😍😍😍
so beautiful ❤❤🫶
Baby you got such a hold on me
And he has flu🥲
"Uauuuu , arrasou !! 💫✌🏻😍🇧🇷"
Nice Le Corbusier and Van der Rohe showroom. And the salesman can sing!
What an amazing performance !
Love!!! Much better than the SNL performance. I love the way there were references to the music video.
❤🇵🇱
And where are the instruments and the dance??? WTF I miss old Justin
Not a single sweat stain in that grey shirt 😮
This is good. Really good
❤️❤️❤️
That's hot
❤ him
Wow!! What else can be said about this man!? He is him!!!
Beautiful!
Amazing. 🎉
"this is my favorite ""Selfish"" performance of yours, Justin! you're amazing! i hope you're feeling better now. i love You, Mr. Timberlake! ❤️"
This man is smooth and cool like silk. Love this ❤
❤❤❤JT
The way the scene cleaning was done together with singing was ingenious❤
👍🧡🧡
Так круто поёт несмотря на простуду  - настоящий профессионал.  Низкий поклон 🙏👍🫶❤️
I love every bit of it!
"Beautifully choreographed! I love the video, and the way translated elements of it to the filming of this was great."
❤❤❤
Come turkey pleaseeee
DamnNn
"Thank you for bringing some true music to the table. can't wait to check the whole album. 
 All the rest of the ""popular demands"" are so broken and nasty. You must be an angel."
"Why didn't he have this arrangement for the actual song, this is leagues better than the bare bones studio version."
That was one of the best performances I've seen.
💜
Je suis trop fan  quand est-ce que un fait un concert en France ? 😮😮
"I’m just so glad and happy his back, I hope he feels better soon, prayers of healing ❤️‍🩹 to his body ❤  protection wherever he goes ❤"
Every second of this performance is my favorite like howww could u be this smooth 🥺
😍😍😍😍😂
Taking me back to when I was young. This man is the real deal!!! ✨✨✨
Love the smoothness of this performance
"Justin does have any bad live perfomance  even with the flu , he dances , sings, he is so good❤❤"
Perfectionnnn
GENIAL Y ORIGINAL ACTUACIÓN
I’m seeing in the comments that he was sick during this performance?! That’s crazy because I think this one was perfect compared to SNL. He was improvising too much in that one but this one he was spot on!
Suka lagu selfish solau milik dek justin  sukses selalu to makappa sanna dek justin see you leather 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
This is way better than the music video. Haha. 😅
"For my next move, I would like exactly that, please."
WELCOME BACK! WHATA COMEBACK!
Perfection to this day ❤
What weird video
El Nuevo Rey 👑 del Pop 🤨⭐️
Back for my 3—hundredth view 🙈
😊
This is beautiful 😻
Bravo JT and all the background singers!  The changes made were perfect ❤
❤❤❤
Wow. The curtain drop lead up. Just so well done and creative way to do a live song and make it like a music video. JT is the best!
Amazing!! 🥹🥰⚠️
"Спасибо,за жизненную песню....❤❤❤"
I prefer Mariah Carey Artificial version with higher notes !!!
"He can't even take some rest to cover up from so called flu.. Just to try promoting his flop music. And selfish.. of course.

Boy, we're not give up untill you will get cancelled for what you did. 

""We already know. We know that from Her. Don't you make you sad about it)))"""
I forgot he existed. I’ll continue to pretend he doesn’t exist.
I like him and ain't gonna be like everyone else and judge a relationship I wasn't part of.
Absolutely amazing
"Thanks JT, We can’t watch your video for this song in Russia"
I wish I was there ❤...
Welcome back JT we have missed a lot but now you are here again Blessings with  this new album ❤
"Wow best live performances during a show I've ever seen.

Apparently he's was sick? 

1. Can't tell!
2. Still Killed it!
3. Hope he is all good now"
Love this song!❤
"iHeart Innovator Award Recipient 2015. 
Justin Timberlake innovates."
🎶🎶🎶👍👍👍🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
This is what we call a real Artist y'all. JT is perfection and  Timeless 🙌
Respect to JT for wearing that Dr.Evil drip 😂😂😂
He’s fkn phenomenal ♥️
Great performance! 👏🏻😊
since NSYNC! #1 fan here from Philippines👌😊
милая песенка.
What an *Amazing* Performance!!!!!!!!!!!
ARTIST
"this is SO GOOD but he looks so sick.  😢 also, whoever is styling him this era is KILLING IT."
Props to the team of creative direction for staging.
aging like fine wine 😍😍
Props too the camera man also..he killed it.
Justin is a wizard. He magically casts a smile on my face.
Who else sweating they wouldn't clear everything out in time...😅
"I still love the fact that JT still has so many fans, like me... He deserves it. 😊😊😊"
Way to break down the set union!
imagine spending years and unspeakable money to become a dancer so you can move furniture on camera
what a great performance!
THAT ENDING!!!! 😱
Wow. That was so entertaining. Nice job to everyone involved. ❤
He's one of the most talented yet underrated artist. Tiktok has destroyed real music
"Ok that was astonishing. I love this song but how they pulled off that choreography, camera work, and the ending was perfect. His moves remind me of old-time classy entertainers."
Immaculate
This song is now on repeat in  my head ❤
This was everything
❤❤❤
Wow!! So so so good!! ❤
"He can reallly sing  and dance , he is a REALLY performer👏❤✊"
cool performance on a small stage - superstar and perfectionist❤
Still better
Omgosh great song 🎵 👌 I love this song so much and I loved this performance ❤️ 💖
I love this song 🎵 ❤️ 😭
He’s lip syncing to prerecorded vocals
It’s drown for me.
Canta tão bem ❤
Que buena canción justin ttttimberlake
"What’s the sneakers he’s wearing? Blue soles. What do we think, he’s using a software on the microphone, yes he does have the flu. I’m liking the uniform fits and jt. Let’s see how the album is. 💯"
Wow. He's sick and still gives an incredible performance! That's dedication for you! Ily JT
Beyond brilliance. What a professional..that was like a video great moves and great song ...wow
"Thumbs down for the Justin.  Justin case he reads this, what you did to Brittney was unforgivable."
Love this man❤
Watched the whole thing with a smile on my face. Love you so much! Fantastic performance!
So incredible. And he powered through being completely sick! Love Justin so much!!!😊
beautiful
"Mesmo não sendo um cantor de voz potente e marcante, ele é um performance incrível! 😊"
Amo demais!❤
Good performance even with the flu ❤️
Knew it.  Soon as he'd shave the beard and get out of the damn woods he'd get the rhythm back.
"This live version better than the original. But as a JT fan, 2 lead singles recently are nothing special, feel something missing on them. Honestly they are not as good as a normal track in Man of the wood, his previous album. I'm pretty sure his new album will flop on all media and steaming."
"Love you Justin, but why are you dressed like Dr. Evil?"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best performance of Selfish yet…choreography was epic!! 🙇‍♀️
JT is pulling this off while Britney is dancing around naked in her kitchen smoking cigarettes and playing with knives. 😂
He did this all while not feeling well! He's a champ.
Isn't that beat a preset on the keyboard?
Amazing!!! 🤟
He cannot be singing this “live” unless this studio has an amazing ability to process sound on the fly. This sounded so over produced and tweaked - it’s truly remarkable that his fan base stays with him.
This is so smooth. I enjoyed this performance and the song is a bop
So happy for him 🔥🔥
Love it. Please visit Seoul !!!
"You'd know an artist is THAT talented when cancel culture can't bring him down despite the media and Britney stans joining together, they've been canceling him since 2017 and he's still making it...GenZ did the same thing to Eminem, and it never worked"
By far the BEST talk show music performance I’ve ever seen. Amazing 🤩
So so pround ❤
IS THIS EVERYTHING WHAT YOU have REQUESTED FROM Graham? ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC !!! SENDING LOVE 😘😘😘🥰
4:10 beautiful
"Temazo, ojala el disco sea de este TENOR"
Amazing performance and my boy has the flu too 🤒 There’s nothing he can’t do! ❤️🎶
Whoa ❤ beautiful song and beautiful photography.... Guess I am Selfish....😎... I hate such people.... 🤗🤗🤗♥️✌️🕊️🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃😎👍
this was so creative Justins always been innovative
"Is this version, 2 Men and a Truck? I haven't seen Mover's ever work that fast in Michigan 🤣"
Your voice is unmatched JT! your music is amazing and you never disappoint ❤😊
It's So nice To See Justin back. He Sounds Amazing.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
That looked like fun.
"Even being sick, you still outshine as an amazing performer. Amazing job! Feel better soon ❤"
If he didn't tell you he had the flu you never would have known.  He's such a fantastic performer.
I’m not selfish. I’m sending this to everyone I know.
Wow. I’m just always blown away by this guy. Amazing performance. He was still giving incredible vocals even while being sick with the flu. Goat/legend. 💕💕💐🔥✨🎶👏🏼👏🏼.
Why was the sound so weirdly vibrating and echoing?
Dang!!!!! That was straight 🔥!!!! I love how every performance is so different. Do yall hear them musicians playing them BEATS!?!? 🔥 🔥 🔥
jamiroquoi  called to say ‘It’s been done’
Finally another selfish performance. Thank you 😭 i’ve been replaying the snl one over and over again like for weeks now 😭

Even with the flu Justin stuns! ❤
He’s so incredible.
Performance art right there…
This is so random and miscellaneous but im glad Kate Winslet got to experience this performance and song idk if she'd heard it before but at least the performance was satisfying knowing she saw it lol I guess cause I'm a big fan of hers and I really love this song 🤷😁😂
I love him🤞🏽♥️
lovely song
Ladies and Gentleman JT is BACK !! ❤
Justin timberlake 😍😍

JT 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 perfect vocals I love him
Really creative the entire performance
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Def a true performer. He can play inst, dancing, and sang ofc."
My man dressed like Dr Evil
"Say what you want about JT, but that was a masterful performance. Props to the director and the people on stage getting every bit of prop out of there in a very well-thought-out way that initially I wasn't sure what was happening until the very end. And of course a lovely vocal performance and the song itself is one of his best."
♥️♥️♥️♥️
VAYA CRACK ESTAS ECHO COLEGA 👍
"What an awesome performance, welcome back King!"
"well, that was quite the performance."
"It’s what I needed tonight. Nice live version. Love how the curtain drops, the colors popped. Oh oh did I see a dance move but.. then again maybe not. 🦧"

Any live version of SELFISH >>>
🎉❤🎉❤
"Love it 🥰 

Amazing performance ❤"
Fell in Like with JT when I saw him on Disney. I think he was 15.... felt like a pedophile. Just an unbelievable dancer. A quarter of a century later and he's still got it.
"Can hear that flu coming out, almost thought they pitched his vocals up an octave."
That was awesome
Wow...
I LOVE YOU JT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Another great song and performance.  Thanks JT for putting out Real music.  It is a delight
When did this air in the us?
"JT is my favourite artist since i was 10 when i didn't understand a single word of his lyrics 😂 from pairing suite with sneakers to learn how to dance in ordre to look cool 😂 to listning to mirror when in love and what goes around when betrayed, it has been quite a journey. Now I am almost 30 and he is still my favourite"
the fact he was doing this while having the flu just shows how much he loves his fans
Get well soon. 🙏Good vibe from BR 🇧🇷 we love you JT ❤
Such a great performance 👏
This is how you do it!!!! In Jimmy Fallons voice!
Poor guys been sick for weeks.hes lost weight.
❤❤❤❤
This is an incredible performance
you never seize to amaze me. this might just be my favorite performance of Selfish❣️
How does one sing so beautifully when sick?! 😭❤
Ohhhhh what a performance 😩
Just beyond greatness and breathtaking.
"Smooth...this right here, is sheer brilliance...👏👏"
Like❤
He’s such a loser
Holy that was better than the actual music video
Imagine sounding this good with the flu! ❤

"The background vocals sound better than the SNL performance

Can't wait for the UK tour xx
So obsessed with this song omg
❤❤❤❤
YES SIR!!!!!! YOU DID THAT!

🖤
Justin sings RnB in a song thats heavy and sludge? Oh yeah boi. They go Ronnie James Dio from 4:00
Awesome. Only Michael Jackson put on shows to equal his 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just needed to comment so he wouldn’t have 666 comments
Good to see the boogie man rapping
Que música incrível 👏👏👏 e que apresentação
Sanctified deveria ser o seu comeback
I love it!!
My God...where has this Guy been hiding. Take us to Church. Absolutely the best  Justin has EVER Done. Now excuse me while I get back to CHURCH!!!!
This song is amazing and this might be my favorite snl performance of all time. Glad JT is back and delivering the kinda music people like me need
Live this song is complete fire.  Studio album version is weak.   So.sad about that.
DAMN!!  ...ONLY HE COULD PUSH HIMSELF UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF GREATNESS!!  ❤❤
"Wow!!! Y'all hit the mark with that one. It's a few minutes past me watching this video and my hair on my arms just can't sit. This song is electric, y'all could not have done any better. The whole performance was a top tier. Keep this energy going u guys."
huge mistake not releasing this as the lead single
He went off. I'm at home screaming for him like he can hear me. 😂
Amazing performance and so well timed for this culture/era! Bravo!!!
As a lifelong metal head… it gives me goosebumps when this gets heavy!
Fantastic musicians and live performance!
ESPECTACULAR
Miles ahead the studio version. That one simply sucks in comparison
Why this is so not good? What happened with his voice?
He don’t quit this perfection both killed it
masterful musical arrangement and production.. will be a long term listen to
He should win a Grammy and Emmy just for this performance.
Yooooo this was 🔥🔥
This song is so sick
I prefer technicolor but this song cool
"Favourite/ best song on the album in my opinion. Giving new old JT, the jt I fell for, this level of musicality and I’m so here for itttt. This goes off liiiive!"
"YESSSS this SONG!!!!!!
🌺🌹💐"
tell ur fuked up team to release this as a live video like say something.. dont let music go to waste because of the trash abusive internet
This was awesome!!
HELL YEAH LETS GO🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤love it
This is easily my fave album of his and this is one of my fave tracks
Now THIS is a performance! 💯✨🥰😌💜💙
Wth is this?
🔥 🔥
One of the rare cases where the studio version is disappointing but the live version is Grammy - worthy!
NOW THAT IS A DISNEY PRINCESS ROYALTY FROM THE START OF BIRTH THANK YOU LOVE FOR COMING FROM THOSE HEAVENS PEACE P.TROY.S PTS 12311968 2022 PARKER STEWART ❤ 💖 💕 ♥ 💙 🙏 ❤ 💖 😊
Banger!
I loveeeee ❤❤❤❤❤this is life
It is amazing the difference in this one and the album version. I love them both but he comes alive when in front of an audience!!!
Where have i heard that beat before? Does somebody know? I know i've heard it in the past for sure.
The best song of the year by far. It should win Grammys for record and song of the year. What a dynamic performance. He just gets better over time.
this sounds so much better than the album version
"Justin is always invited to the cookout.. End of story..
Blackest White Dude Ever.. This is straight 🔥"
This is SO GOOOOOOD!
The distortion it’s setting it off for me
"I'm not a big fan of Justin Timberlake, but I confess he's been surprising me with his new music. I'm really enjoying it!"
This is tight!
☀️
"If you can win Emmy’s for songs performed on SNL, this should be an Emmy winner"
The views on this vid are too low
"at my age, could this be possibly the best music vid I've ever seen? by the way, I'm 70"
Im commenting AGAIN damn it!!! 😂lol im so addicted to THIS PERFORMANCE!!! ❤❤😭😭
FKN BAD ASSSSSSS!!! PERIOT! 🔥🔥🔥🖤🖤
this was so good now why the studio version sound like it was recorded through the hole of a donut
"I gotta be honest, most of the new album has its highs and lows but I have ALWAYS been enamored by how JT and Co. find ways to bridge R&B with the variety of genres he’s had the chance to work in.  Between tracks like Say Something and Drink You Away, this is another banger in the same vein."
Nothing like a good ole song of blasphemy lol
One of the Best SNL performances ever
JT going for jugular with this one! 💯👏🏾
so groove than studio
After listening to the album version I have decided the live version is better. The beat doesn’t hit the same on the album. And it’s usually the opposite with most artists
"The way THIS version is so different than the original, has me really excited for the tour 😍"
I love this set this is the JUSTIN I remember
Why is this better than the studio version ✌🏼😅
🙌👍
His new songs are great!!❤😊
Wow! I love this SNL arrangement & mix!!!
This live version shows just how magical Justin is..in all respects!  Amazing!  Way better than the studio album version.  PLEASE RELEASE THIS AS A SINGLE! 👍👍
This song is dope! 🔥🎸🤘🏻
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Concert vibes on SNL. That audience got a 2 for 1 on those tickets.
Petition to have this on Spotify! 🙏🏻
That kicked ass!! Justin and Tobe took me to church and rocked me out!!! Best track on the album imo. 🙌🏼❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙌🏼
This crew is so tight... Love those power chords!
JT was eating that shoulder bop up 🔥🔥🔥
This 💩💩💩is bad as hell!!!! Another hit for Justin and Tobe!
He just don't know how to perform poor!   GIFTED!!!!!🎉
🔥
The band🔥🔥🔥! Instrumental pleeease🙏🏾
Best Performance Ever ❤️
"Wow, what a performance. 🔥🔥🔥"
"Flop, flop, flop"
Insane!!!
💚💚💚💚👍🙏
D a d d y
"By God, this man keeps on showing the world why...!"
HE IS BACK ❤
Love all the songs BUT this one.. 🔥🔥
"Great song! He’s such a great dancer, too! Excellent performance!!"
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#justintimberlake nasty for this straight fire 🔥
LOVE it!❤❤❤
#nolifeshaq please react I'm begging you
#nolifeshaq I promise you will love this
This song was fire until the other guy started rapping about the monster in his loins going boing.
👍
🔥 📛 👨‍🚒
🇷🇺
4:04 can we talk about that?
"this album is SO good and much better than the man of the woods album, this is lowkey like his old sound which is superior tbfh and he looks like himself back then too, just needs to put back on the suit and he's back to his golden years"
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Great live performance. Why does the album version fall flat?
THE BEST!
"This is a epic and on fire, 100% pure art. 🥇🥇🥇✨️✨️✨️🎗🎗🎗💯💯💯🌟🌟🌟⭐️⭐️⭐️"
JT and Tobe killed this!!
"What's with the lady sitting in the front row in costume during Tobe's part? Is she being punished or something? (you can see her at 3:12 when they ""swoop down"")"
Fucking Immaculate 🔥 👏👏👏❤️
He’s a baaaddddd man
I 👏🏾 LOVE 👏🏾 Tobe 👏🏾
This rides.
I feel like all the caption needed to say was “You’re welcome! 😏”
❤❤❤
GREAT
i was there with my friends and i remember going crazy when this was performed
RELEASE THE LIVE VERSION PLZ!! The Band is pure gold ✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS FIREEEE!!!!! JT and Tobe together 🫶🏽
His new album is a musical !!!!
Love it! I see art in it!
what's his main point in this song?
I like this better then the studio version in the album
the beast
Essa música tem sample de uma musica do michael jackson
This is the flyest shit in years
Amazing comeback...💙💛
He so perfect
love his versatility he's amazing signing and artist
😜👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️🥳🤓
This song 🤌🤌🤌
"I have NO IDEA why, everybody thinks, this is so good, and a hit. It’s got more auto than Katy Perry and Ava Max‘s love child! Plus, it’s just noise solid noise. The song reminds me of something you would see at a dive bar on the river by amateurs. Just saying"
The song so good
And that’s how you come back from 6 years.Bravo JT!🙌🏻
I missed  you
This is awesome 👌.  Justin Bieber you almost out did Yourself.
He is  so fine. And the best 👌 Angela 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤is 😂😂😂😂
Great duo
Il a beaucoup vieillit le JT 😢
fecking fire.
Just whoa
Kicking with your bad self . Straight up jamming
AdA meeds too get  a witness on the 15th district
Omg..walking streets in TN. Upper Cumberland
I was looking for NIN sanctified but JT is cool too
Trash 🗑️
Who is this song directed to?
"…thus is GirL’y sheet…buuuaa…

…this is best thing you ever created 🙄…me mfck)"
Just Justin…
Goosebumps.
"👍 SO BEAUTYFULL, GREAT... 🎉"
The song reminds me of tonéx’s song personal Jesus
Love this song jam it every day. I will see him in concert.
justin why you allowing the nsync losers trolls taking over ur album stealing ur moment ? how do you let them take the lead on ur album..the song sounds like it was written for trolls not ur album.. dont bow down to those parasites ..the song is cringe anyway
"já estava com saudades, que bom que repostaram ... aguardando ansiosamente o novo album... amando todos os lançamentos."
The change at 2:03 did it for me🔥🔥
PLEASE put this version on spotifyyyyyy <3
"Turning SNL into Sunday Morning Service 😂🙌 Praise be, Justin Timberlake!"
"""Future Sex Love Sound"" feels so long ago. What happened?"
❤
I know he won’t release unless it is perfect … but DAMN I am so hungry for a new JT 💿 album!!
Bravo❤
What if sanctified was the lead single?!!!
Bemloko gostei muito 👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This live version is so good I hope he releases it in addition to whatever studio version is on the album. It’s just amazing.
This is amazing
Yay Tobe🎉🎉
O vocal do JT nunca decepciona ❤
"Honestly one of his best ever songs, this actually hits so so hard"
❤😮wonderful
"Talend talend magical, really good...from Spain"
There's nothing JT can't do! Dangit boy! 👏
"Testify, Justin! 👌"
🔥🔥🔥
Wow😮 im exciting 😮
"🤦🏼What does it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, yet loses his own soul for eternity?😮‍💨
It's an eternal fail 🤷🏼 No amount of talent can disguise the fact the some vessels were created for destruction 🤷🏼 it's grevious to the spirit and I pray that none would be deceived and led astray for following spiritual failures, such as this 😞 the sole thing that exists in this reality that has the power and ability to sanctify anyone or anything is the blood of Jesus Christ. Perverting definitions and vulgar contexts like this example, is infantile and not to mention lacking any originality 🤷🏼🤦🏼😮‍💨 ugh"
This is Filthy's and sexyback's lost child
His whole career is nothing in comparison to one of Britney spears songs
Boom JT! 👏💌
Free Palestine
"Hey, if you made $60K before listening to this music tune in here let's gooooo!!!!......"
Incredible performance!!
All I can say is Wow such a great song and a great performance ❤️
"Been following his career a long time, this performance reminds me of the incredible collab he did with Chris Stapeleton on stage. He can sing ANYTHING!!!!!"
That reverb on the mic is trash smh song fire tho
WOW 👏🏻
Excellent 🎉
Goosebumps anyone?
Fenomen ❤❤❤
THAT WAS CRAAAZY!!!!
"Great vocals. But does Justin know the Savior my Lord who died for our sins. Or is he just using the gospel music and sainty of Church for a comeback. Justin, you sang your heart out, but is it anointed by God the Creator. Don't mistake talent for anything but talent if it's not used for the right Kingdom!"
Oh mon dieu😮😮😱 magnifique
It would be interesting to hear what God would say regarding this song and video.  We will all hear from him in due time.
"I'd like to hear the raw feed, hear what he really sounds like,  This performance sounds strange."
Nice performance
I cant wait to get this cd!!
He put both feet in on this!!!❤❤❤
we need a visual album plzzzz. this is the only way to give the album justice
most of the snippts we heard so far is so fire.. this album will be misjudged by the singles.. every song sounds like a smash
Cant nobody deny this mans TALENT!!! ❤❤❤ FN AWESOME
🔥🔥🔥❣
🩷
When is the release date of sanctified on iTunes
I think his a better producer of music then singer.
another EPIC JT/SNL musical production! I'm positive the tour will be phenomenal!
Some feel .. history
calling up justin f old team..ppl wont understand the concept of the album shown in the album concept photos if you dont actally release the personal songs as singles ..this is already too subtle for the stupid internet ..
Leather Tape sing it true.
why was it taken down at snl youtube ? ! also this should be a single and have a video in church ..in your grandfather church for ex .. or in the cemetry ..we thought you shot sanctified in the cemetry not no angels
❤
"Day one fan right here. This slaps, this bangs, this EFFS right here. Love me some Justin.. get it Bae🤎"
From man of the woods to the man of the fucking world
Amazing Justin 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"Love it!!  Im 40, and before i was saved, and way back when i was in my 20s / 30s i used to party to Justins world music from way back when, but stopped listening to world music as its just become so vulgar, and woke and the Christian pop and rock music sectors have just blown up, way more talented people and real music being produced than mainstream. Very excited to see JT in this space, even if its just for a minute.... 😊"
Flop
I've loved you from day one!  I'm still your #1 fan!!!!! From a 55 year old momma with a 41 year old husband...  Love me some Justin!!¡!!!
I Like it!!!
I love you 💋
That was badass!

"Yo, this song is 🔥,  but can we talk about those backup singers? The whole performance was incredible."
FINALLY!!! 😍😍😍💓💓💓
That was great my sexy man's back
"Can't wait for the album! The vibe kind of reminds me of ""only when I walk away"" from 20/20 experience."
Now this is the one.
He deserves a grammy
Imagine this featuring Beyoncé and Kendrick🤯
Why was this taken down before 😭

Почему удалили видео его живого выступления с песней selfish на этой передаче?
Perfect

🎉🎉🎉🎉
"I normally dont care for his music but theres always a song here and there that is really good. This is one of them. Love the different styles rolled into one.

Anyone know why it was taken down?"
Totally awesome !   🙏🏻EVERYTHING
"что за еп твою мать,вы гоните.."
Reupload?
"I love him. One of the most talented artists out there. That being said, not a huge fan of this."
RELEASE THE ALBUM ALREADY JT!!!!! CAN´T WAIT!!! :D
His bonus singers are INSANE!!!! This is Justin’s element. I never went to church but this is the one I’d want to go to if it were
I love Justin he is huge in my life. But without Timberland there is something missing.
Lovely and Wonderful❤️. Let all men be sanctified after watching this peice 😊
Love this song❤
Icon !!
How did I know this was about to be blasphemous.
"I just realised how good this song actually is ! 
The performance blew my mind 🤯💯💯"
If JT and JK collaborate on a new song or perform 3D live or make a video one day that will be so awesome 😎
…and wgere is lyrics 😩
Still on the brain 💋
I'm a super fan for years! But ur ego must change or u will lose everything! I care..look at the views are super down. U used to get millions now not so much 😕 ❤u always. But be humble and sit down.
eeeeeeyyy
It’s official. 2024 is Justin TimberYEAR! 🔥 🐐👑

ARRASOU JUSTIN!!!!!!!
Amen
What was that oh I know what it was freaking amazing!
"First two singles were fire, this one sucks unfortunately."
Thank you for putting this back up!
King
He’s got that something that makes you admire him and aspire to be like him.
MASTERPICE❤
So happy that this amazing performance is back on YouTube. 💞💞💐✨🔥🔥🎶🙌🏼.
Reupload?? Why?
♓🎯J📧. 📣🔈🔉🔊🆘.🪱🪳🦂🦈🦨🐊🐺🐭🦊🐷💡
Why was this not the lead single?!
"Love this. 
Please release this as a single"
My absolute favorite! I was bummed when they took it down!
"This is giving me 20/20 vibe all over again, and no I'm not talking about the sound, I'm talking about the formula and quality...when he released Suit&Tie as a debut single, everyone was mocking and making fun of it...then he released Mirrors which became a huge hit, then released the album and became an instant classic, and as it turned out, Suit&Tie was the weakest track on the whole album...I'm sensing the same thing to this, Selfish received a lukewarm response but Sanctified and Drown are straight 🔥🔥🔥 and if Selfish is the weakest track on the album, this means we're gonna get one hell of a masterpiece of an album"
"What a viiiibe, wow. Worth watching every second"
Respect!
I was vibing SO HARD to this song until the rap breakdown. It kills the mood for me. Thank God the song picked up again afterwards. This is a banger!
✝️💖🔥
Justin Amazing guy ❤❤❤
excellent!
Love it
Yayy!! This video is back!!
""
Modern day Elvis… let’s go

Now that’s a performance 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Sexy is back! ❤ ALL the way back!
"Justin and Tobe!!! OMG, an awesome song"
Pure class
We need Audio now
"The song could be so much better if the effect he has on the vocal was more subtle. 
It's a sound choice he has used in the past(or similar), in songs like sexyback but it's so exaggerated in this one. 

I still have 17 other songs to enjoy on the album tho so no problem 😊"
This was STRAIGHT 🔥! Please Jesus let the album version be exactly the same. If not PLEASE RELEASE THIS VERSION
This is going to be Justin Bieber at this age 😊❤
YES! JT IS THE MAN!!! Can I get a witness?!?! 🙌❤👏 LOVE HIM!
So glad you reposted this. I LOVE this song. It really deserves to be a single and needs a video! Please Justin!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧡💛
Sanctified where did you go ??? I have  missed you a lot lol
"Yay, Justin, you put it back on for us all! Good man! ❤"
Damn!

Seems like a song that would be in fifty shades
This song is mid 🥱
I can't wait to see him later this year❤
Always the best performer
Vauvvv🤩👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌺🌺🌺
"Uno de mis artistas favoritos, nunca me defrauda con sus shows en vivo. 🎶🎤💯 Saludos desde Ecuador🇪🇨"
"Great song, the arrangement is just a bit to open and bland, and lacks some extra finesse... I want more guitars or some synths or something... It's a bit too open..."
""
He’s so talented! Glad to see him bringing sexy back
Ele vai cantar no nosso 🎁🫂🇧🇷🙏🕊️🤳🕊️🕊️🎯😉

Soulful production givin’ praise to our savior—glad to have discovered this.

De verdad necesito esta presentación en spotify :(
2 seconds in and I was hooked. He puts out nothing but hits!!
Loser
Why did you delete your performance of “Selfish” on SNL? Are you going to delete this one as well tomorrow?
Why did he re-upload this? It came out weeks ago
I'm always watching you from Myanmar I love you guys.
Good❤
I can hear a multigenre in this piece. Deymm JT
I feel like the album isn’t out yet and people are been forgetting the hype or care
This has 20/20 Experience Era of JT vibes all over it I truly believe this should’ve been the first single for “Everything I Thought It Was” album seriously!🥵🤝🏽🙌🏽🔥✨
Justin can this please be a single with an official video?? 😭🫶🏻💛
"I'm excited next Friday for Everything I Thought It Was, it's gonna be a great album when it comes out"
Wow! 😍😍😍😍😍
thank you king 🥹
Am I the only south african 🇿🇦 who like j-t here...?
"Still remember hating nsync as a kid... then he went out on his own and a friend dragged me to his concert and I became an instant fan that night.  He was such an amazing performer!  Performed dick in a box and everything at the show bahaha.  Had a broken pinky and still played guitar,  piano and keyboard...Love me some JT! 💜✨️"
q week
"Terrific Performance 
I 💜 this song and the choir interaction was great. Looking forward to seeing you on Tour this Summer"
One Life ☝️
Holy fuck. JT next Friday can't come soon enough 😮😮

"I'm glad this got reuploaded, I was wondering where it went 😂😂"
The Best.СЛАВА УКРАIНI.
Super
Suber
Are they going to stay together?
Any boy band today wishes they could make a comeback this good. Also it’s interesting that the more times you listen to this song you can hear all of them individually rather than it sounding like one person is singing more than the others.
"Olha só pra cara dos outros integrantes do N'Sync: um mais trouxa que o outro,sendo usados pra promover JT! Kkk o q JT não faz pra retomar a própria carreira né? Nem tem comparação com os BackStreetBoys que durante todos esses anos continuaram trabalhando juntos"
I love this 😍
I love this song❤
Im glad that this is in one of my fav movies💗🫷❤️💗💗❤️❤️❤️🌺
My Family and I hear this song everyday. I'm glad My kids can enjoy Nsync the way I did. 😃
Cheeky bammmmmmmm
Yoohoooo!
Voice like Morten Harket .
<3
I need a official music video!!  😍
I never listened to *NSYNC but I love the songs after 23 years of it but I am so happy for the fans waiting after 23 years to have you guys back so happy
"Jc sold it for me, I miss them together jamming like this, straight up bop!"
Eles são otimos juntos eu amooo❤
"Yes *NSYNC my fav Boy Band is back 😭😭😭😭😭 Like mabye people think I was an *NSYNC fan before but I am just 10 yrs old! How could I be an *NSYNC fan before watching Trolls: Band Together?? This is Trolls song omfg 😭😭😭😭 I love it my fav song in my fav movieeeee :""DDD"
Who is here after watching the new trolls movie? 😂😂😂😂❤
Puerto Rico te ama Justin ❤🎉
Just let me take you to a better place
"I remember when they were in town with ""I Want you Back"". Soo wish I had gone to see them by myself since no one else would!!  Great when the first song came out and they just keep rockin'. ❤❤"
"Dude with the purple hair, the gay one, must have had several facial surgeries.   Horrible"
Trolls fun
I wanted a music video 😭
"We're all aging, but just some 20-22 yrs. back these guys were so hot. I took my granddaughter to their concert, here in Milwaukee. I bought her & her brother a kareoke system. We would all sing ""bye, bye, bye into the mics along with the group. Nice, fun times."
When I come back from shcool I  dance with trolls band together songs 😌
This song is just ❤❤❤
I was Nsync fan but this is rub bish
와 추억 돋는다... 다들 멋드러지게 늙으셨네... 나도 늙.. ㅜ
🫶💫❤️‍🔥
Wooooooo wow a 🤯 song man its cool 👍
Love the Mario cameo at 1:04
"Did the Trolls movie bring them back together, or did they reunite just to make a song for the Trolls movie?"
Had no idea this was even them. Ive been a huge fan since back then. Bless up.
The whistle in the background during the intro almost ruins it.
The boys are back 🎉
It's nice to have N'Sync back together

JT & JC sound great together.
"I love how so many 40 something men confess how excited they are at a new Nsync song and how in their youth they were closeted fans. Hey, talent is talent and no apologies for recognizing it as a boy."
"Here are The lyrics🤩🤟

I kept looking for this song just now and I totally didn't expect that this song is by N'Sync!  I am a big fan of N'Sync. I'm 38 years old and this song is really awesome!! I would dance my fingers when I listen to this song in my car
Best song 10/10

Which wtf
I like it 😍😍😍😍
oMG!!! Love this song from *NSYNC. This is in the Trolls movie
"I'm into Justin Timberlake's voice. It's soulful and just relaxed and effortless compared to the other's. I came here because the short video had his voice thinking he had a new album out but nope. I don't care for some of the other voices. It sounds strained, tense and not relaxed."
"CRY ME A RIVER
WHERE ARE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE OF 90""S
I LOVE YOUR SOUL AND  YOUR BODY
THAKE THAT OR tHIS NOW 911!!!


AND I WANT DO THAT
LIKE TAKE THAT IN 1996
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD
A TEEN
I BELIEVE TURNING ELECTRICITY
CAUSE IT GOES AROUND THE WORLD LIKE MIKORWELLE
LIKE THE WATER IN THE WC

"Generic pop song #324. Boring ass music, I remember when N*Sync used to have unique songs."
Justin is nothing compared to Eminem. *NSYNC is not popular as a group and unnecessary...🙏🏿🦶🏿🦵🏿🖕🏿🦵🏿🤢
Anybody watching this after trolls band together ✋
I love NSYNC
I love this song
the fans have spoken ... no one gives a fuck for only 700k views
"Beaches, temperate climates and affordable living. That’s the dream for many, and some are looking to make that dream a reality abroad."
😭🤐
😭😭
"While money undoubtedly makes some things in life easier, it can create complications in other ways."
"Since I was young I watched Trolls 1 when I was in primary school,then before getting to high School i watched Trolls 2 World Tour but now I watched Trolls 3 Band together with my family🎉🎉🎉

37 years old here yes old days 90s day in 2023 2024 i was so excited this movie with my twin sister and her kids who are 9 and 10 so awesome for them to experience it 30 years later
Oh he trying to get people to forget the book 😂😂😂 he never cared about N'Sync but now he conveniently wants to be a group again
"Jamas crei que volverian a unirse , creci escuchando Nsync , mi hermano mayor en ese entonces era un adolescente , ahora el ya es un adulto , yo tengo 25 años y lo escucho desde que yo tenia 5 años , aun recuerdo , yo solo era un niño y ver esos posters pegados en las paredes de la habitacion de mi hermano waaooo cuanta nostalgia"
"L'ho ascoltata la prima volta grazie alla pubblicità di ""Trolls 3"""
the best music

"Now you are putting crap out about Britney, you are such a bloody child, when will you grow up?  What you did way back then was wrong, very wrong, and she gets to speak on it finally after getting out of a living horror show.  If you were a man you would have apologized directly, letting her know you are sorry for the pain she will never lose, like friends pfft.  You really think you are all that and a bag of beans, but you are not, and your wife should not mention Britney in a derogatory fashion, she looks small and inconsequential doing that.  Don't do it again, don't drag her like you been trying to, do you want her gonzo you sick mongrel because you are not worth it."
😮
Listening to this on my way out of a NYC subway station always gives me a kind of satisfaction😂
I want video!!!

justin hi tell lance it is davina stefinies niese
Hello  NSYNC
❤❤❤
Super numer chlopaki...❤
"Bye Bye Bye, Justin"
"It's a sad fact.
Get it wrong, and it loses all it's flavour and nuances.
Get it right, and you ""feel"" more than hear all the actual content, both out in the open, as well as deep within (hidden) yet the ears hear everything, if everything is in there, to hear."
"No wonder they say Justin Timberlake is having a sort of ""misery-state""
I would too, if the only sound your recording technician can produce, is this dead pan MONO rubbish, with oh yeah, SOME Mid-tones and Tweeting/screeching high-tones in the rear, that makes this lad SICK of crappy mastering/remastering by idiots who do NOT know how to pan & fade as wide as possible, when I do know for a fact, that there are a multitude of ""placements"" that accompaniment and other bass instruments etc., can be ""placed"" instead of cramming the front of stage with every piece of hardware, with your singers ""squished"" between it all.
What a cacophony of sound it makes, when every track is laid into the front and BARELY just a little of the squeaky mid/high & very high sections (to each side) - containing not very much ""punch"" at all, placed as if a foot behind the lead singer?
What about the rest of the studio / sound stage?
Did you put this together in a deadpan (soundless) shoebox?
That's what I get via my remastering studio's audio gear, when listening to this, as if I too was in your mastering/remastering studio.
Not very much - in the way of DEEP & MEANINGFUL, rear surrounds, are there, and with absolutely NO Bass tones / instruments there at all.."
"Not overly ""happy"" with this release..
It is a sure-fire PITY, that your studio engineer did NOT put more emphasis on the surrounds rather than simply putting some mid/high & treble over there.
It definitely needs a LOT MORE BASS in the backing tracks.
How the hell are your ""listeners"" supposed to get with it, to the beats in this song, if you deliberately ""leave them out"", by producing a MONO with a hint of stereo via HIGH TONES either side?
For starters, the ""whistling"" could have been placed dead center AT THE BACK OF THE STAGE, where most sounds ""appear"" to disappear - (unless one has the correct analogue surround sound decoder, to extract it all, in it's glorious finery).
ECHOES, do not just appear at the rear, they appear EVERYWHERE on stage, not only to the sides either, but some float across the stage from areas near the drummer, or perhaps the piano accompaniment sometimes one has a ""monitor"" track that could also be faded into the rear somewhere.
Don't just ram it all into the very front channel, as all you get is mic overload, leaving that area toned down to avoid distortion, which also drags all the other content well below audible hearing, meaning that your ""sound"" sounds horridly MONO. 
You need DEPTH as well as staged positioning, (of a lot more bass drums as well as BASS guitars etc., in the back of the stage areas) to have a LOT more musical and vocal content, ""heard"" during a two channel vinyl record or tape PLAYBACK, to allow the listener to close their eyes and ""make believe"" that there's something there, BEHIND the lead sinner, & not hearing as if EVERYTHING is at exactly the same place, on top of the lead singer's position..!!!!"
"Uh, I'm in my prime, Optimus
Sagittarius (Britney), so you know I'm an optimist
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)
Was it worth it, dummy (Justin)? I ain't mind a bit
Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip"
JUST LEMME TAKE U TO BETTER PLAAACEEEE
addicted gila…
FREE Britney
"There personal lives are there business..
I’m in for the Art ..
They’re so talented!!"
Love this song!!!
A celebrity is a CELEBRITY geez no one’s perfect…I certainly am NOT but in another’s eyes I might be 💋
Shame on you Justin
"Like me having come back from AC DC, Rainbow, Guns & Roses, and so many more…i just missed 80-90s…"
God!!!! I've waited so many years!!!!! In my 40ties and dancing my ass off while tidying up😅😅😅😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤  Finally!!! Hugs from Italy!
Britney Spears!!!!!! ❤
I had your dolls. This is soooooo nostalgic for me ❤❤❤
أغنيه جميله رائعه جدا اتمنى لك التوفيق والنجاح الدائم في عملك يعجبني جدآ 💯💯
You ever get too hard up you know where the end of my fist is at.
Don't kill yourself. Cause that's where that's at unless you just picking up some bitches for the night and cocaine. Don't kill yourself...
who else has this on repeat???
Sorry Britney!!!
🤡🤡🤢🤢🤢💩
My god JC still has that sultry voice still after all these yrs and I’m still a *NSYNC fan for life

JUSTIN WOULD HAVE NEVER REACHED ANY HEIGHT WITHOUT BRITNEY! WHAT A LOSER! HAIL BRITNEY!
"SAY SORRY TO BRITNEY, Justin !!!!!"
JUSTICE FOR BRITNEY! JUSTIN 🤮

BUENA CANCION

You were a monster with Britney. I hope you get the karma you deserve….
Cancel this small dicked white man!

"You are a terrible person remember that

Absolutely incredible song!
Take notes from a true Gentleman and Artist: Johnny Depp.

Good tune timberland ❤
"TE AMO, JUSTIN!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚"
Pathetic man! He should be in jail rn!
i don't like the whistling ....
Baby killer
How could you do that to Britney? It's no wonder you have your Instagram comments off. You know you're wrong! I was your biggest fan growing up. I can't believe you left her to the wolves like that. Did you ever check on her over the years?? Lend an ear?? Defend her in public even once? Acknowledge any post she made for you? No. You didn't. She only carried your first child ever. Smh. I will never look at you the same and hope your success stops and hers STARTS AGAIN. Be accountable. Apologize.
@justintimberlake My daughter loves the Trolls.
"JT, Cry me a river… ohh… Cry a river…. Your career is BYE BYE BYE… we know all about you using Britney and Janet to get ahead."
watched trolls yesterday was dancing in the movies ahahaha bring back memories 😍😍
"Normally I dont write comments. However, this song is great. Keep it coming Nsync you still sound great!!!"
😡😡😡😡😡
JC you vere fantastic back in the day  but now you are even  better  keep up the good. work don't  ever loose that smile   sunshine of my life xxxxx love you ALWAYS ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Brilliant 😊
Justin and JC together again.  ❤
🤍💙🩵*NSYNC✈️🌍backJustinTimberlake
thanks for you ....
**NSYNC can hold it’s own without Justin Timberlake.. JC and the boys have it♥️
"JT, who’s crying a river now? If I were Britney, I would have exposed you long time ago. She was too kind and in love with you ."
Por uno pagan todos 😢
What you did to Britney and Janet is sick. You shout be in jail and canceled !!! I hope Karma will get you hard and all who were involved . You are one sick !!@#@ 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
CANCEL Justin Timberlake.
Britney sent me keep on running coward
Constant rehearsal for a choreography with intro 👍👌💪 🤖
You make my day!!
"Mega, nach soooo vielen Jahren❤. Ich finde es einfach nur geil😊🤗🤩😍🥰"
❤❤❤MEGA🥰🥰
It’s time to apologize to Britney
"It’s just not right when you build your career on shaming your former partner, brag about sleeping with her, criticise her for losing virginity to gain sympathy of public, tell her to stop drinking in an award speech when she was grieving for the child she lost. That is the lowest of low. You just don’t do things like this if you are a good man."
와 브리트니에게 나쁜짓해놓고 지가 피해본인간처럼 굴었다는게ㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 나쁜새끼네
And JC cut your hair PLEASE!!!!
"Guide them on the right path teacher Justin Timberlake.
My favorite boys band all time, My respects to all"
"You monster you are disgusting
May your murdered baby rest in heaven for ever"
"Shadiest straight man in the universe, yucks! Gotta go….."
After hearing the backstory I can’t see Justin the same way no more bruh you’re worst of the worst…
❤❤❤
If you want world war 3 so bad I think you should go to the front lines and see if any of you fans will join you..   Such a pathetic excuse for a human being 🤦🤦🤦
They must really be needing the reunion money huh😂 . J.T is trash.
"Have some balls, Justin! You deserve a bad karma"
"Backstreet boys siempre fueron más hermosos, talentosos, exitosos a nivel Mundial, ustedes solo tuvieron éxito en estados unidos 🤢😂😂"
reminds me of a kpop song. Nice job nsync
"As someone who never really paid attention to what was going on back in the late 90 early 2000s I've got a lot to say. You are most probably a significant reason that so many men from my generation are big giant dicks. The way you were able to get away with assaulting Janet Jackson and humiliating Britney Spears, OMG. I HOPE EVERYTHING GETS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. THAT IS WHAT YOU DESERVE."
ooohhh brother THIS GUY STINKS !!
Comprario todos los discos si se volvieran a unir para crear las mejores canciones de todo el mundo y soy de latino america ❤ son geniales 🎉
Fav song of the year i do t care if the world spins faster music louder waves get stronger
https://youtu.be/jHgOvf7710k?si=pTPh75JiXFblsMxM
"If it wasnt for Britney, you wouldnt exist. You are Cardi B to Nicki Minaj. As for your career, dead, ghostbuster. Y U Mad, baby murderer?"
"“What goes around goes around goes around, comes all the way back around..” Right, Justin? 😂"
"Yeah nice music, but now go and apologize to Britney Spears for destroying her life, or try to get her out of the mess, is the least you could do. She loved you so much, but you fucked her in all the ways you wanted and discarded her, you lied about everything, cry me a river is what you should be doing now. It's truly bizarre how people can literally be walking demons in the flesh and commit such atrocities to another, and yet go about in this life like they are totally innocent. You should understand that this life has laws and unless you apologize to Brintey and get her the best support that's out there, which is what a man should naturally do, you shall never be a happy man as long as you live on this earth"
Well done Justin timber lake your band is amazing 🤩 well done NSYNC
Love the song. Where is the video?
Cancel Justin he sucks ….
"I'm 50, I love Justin by himself....but with Nsync to....I always have!!! ❤❤❤❤"
They gotta come back! Come back tour please!!! You better believe my 40-something year old butt will be there!!! Nsync fan forever!!
"You're an A.S.S.H.O.L.E, Justin Dickberlake 😏😏 For treating Britney like that"
Unsubscribe
Who is after Trolls3?
Justin benefited off of humiliating female celebrities Britney and Janet and he should NOT be rich and famous HES TRASH!!!
#canceljustintimberlake
We are so excited to see your downfall Justin. For all the mean things you ever said about Britney for maaany years.
you coerced britney to kill your baby 🤮
flop
KKKKKKKK😊
I boycotted you JT! What goes around comes right back around .. you said it best! ♥️Britney! What you did was HORRIBLE!
There’s no such thing as bad publicity booh.✌️😽🧉👸
Boring song. Flop
#thewomaninme
How dare you?
"Omg! We were in the van my 15 year old says what's this? Lol I say I like the beat! And think to myself I love his voice! (When I hurd JC)my two littles ask me to put it on in the house, and when I saw who sings it. I yelled omg! No wounder I love this song lol and I'm disappointed I didn't know off the bat who it was. I loved you guys back than and I still love you guys!"
"This video literally is a big joke, what goes around must comes around, KARMA is waving at you now boi!!! 😂💩👋"
truly a dispiseful human being
Say sorry to britney and the baby!!!
"Shame on you Justin!! At the end of the day, we are backing the FEMALE you disgraced all those years ago!!!"
Look at this pos of a human
You really can recognize JT's voice  ❤
"My mom loved *NSYNC I’m so glad they did this for the trolls movie, I never thought I wanted to watch it but my mom always talked about them and it feels like she still has some child in her like me because I’m still a teen, I never thought my mom would like boy bands like I do right now. I’m so excited for November to come around, the date of the moving airing is coming near my mom’s birthday too. So many kids already like this song!"
This comeback song is very disappointing 😒
Dude ngl that *NSYNC joke was funny af
"Now I understand the real meaning of ""every time - Britney Spears "" shame on you Justin Timberfake ...
SHAME ON YOU ... I lost my respect and admiration for you."
Disgusting!
"You are mean, Justin."
"a man who cheats on his girlfriend, gets a 19 yo pregnant, pressures her to get an abortion, dumps her by text and spends years boosting his career by slutshaming her. pure trash. 
i hope the last of his stans will finally see him as the weak, selfish and pathetic little man he's always been"
"I'm 61 yrs old, and I remember when my kids, especially my 36 yr old daughter were CRAZY NSYNC fans, so this brings me back to that wonderful time when both my kids and I were young !!! I too loved NSYNC songs and I love this song too !!!"
He united Eastern feminists and Southern Baptists all together. This is such a great achievement that no president in US history has ever done. 😂😂😂
"Yikes, selfish little man"
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
You are a very small man Justin. You can never take the high road and do something just because it is right. Everything needs to be manipulative and help your career. Sometimes using someone that’s hurt is just wrong. You benefited from misogyny in the past but hopefully you can make this right by helping Janet and Britney out of the goodness of your heart for once. What did you do since your last apology for them?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ yahoooooooo!!!! ( I just had my 54th birthday yesterday  lol!!  ). Love it!
Abortionist
Con lo que ha salido de Justino lo siento NSYNC pero BYE BYE BYE
"I don’t trust any of Britney’s exes, but you pressured a nineteen-year-old to not have a baby when it was your fault in the first place, and then decided you did not want it anymore like your career since your most popular song is from the Trolls Movie."
Justin is really one revolting human being for the way he *treated Britney.  He just ruined nsync with his atrocious behavior.  BYE! BYE! BYYYYEEE!!!
"What a creep Justin is for getting Britney to have an abortion. The nerve to have her unalive a baby then to turn around and have others. At least his kids one day will know, he got rid of the first sibling."
Ahh so sad.. broh u also dragged them up.
💉💉💉💉💉💉💉👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻
Watched the movie yesterday. Was grooving to this. 🎉 surprised to see Nysnc in the titles. Good look on the message
Chill song

Voces intactas como si no hubieran pasado 20años
Fuckin ramen head
Justin’s the worst in the group
I ❤ love you Nsync 🎉 from Trisha
O que Zelensky está fazendo aí?
❤❤❤❤❤❤🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  NSYNC are Back
🥱🥱 Don’t come back.. this gen stands with B… it going to be a flop… I hope it flops so hard that you vanish from the industry bye bye narcissist boy..
Yes. The baby you forced to abort definitely needs a better place to rest in peace.
Justin💩💩💩💩 wacala
Yo bring back the dance vibes again no more violence and destruction everywhere 🙏
"We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that’s right you wasn’t there 🙊"
What’s going to be the fate of Trolls 3?
"Looking what he did to Janet Jackson and Britney it seems that Justin is a bad guy. It seems that he is too selfish. Maybe its true that Nsync is  returning just because the release of Britneys book.
I feel sorry for the rest Nsync guys 💪"
Unsubscribed....I lost respect for you.  What goes around comes around!  #Justiceforbritney
Great news!!
Thanks to kiss FM radio 📻 for playing this song while I was driving 🫶
"C O B A R D E.
Los 🥚 no solo son para hacer espermatozoides, también para amarrarselos bien para responder como HOMBRE."
He dodged a bullet having a baby with that nutcase
JUSTIN KONTL LO ANJG
*Nsync with Justin Timberlake is more like *Nstink.
Im crying...😢
How funny is that they are back now. Why now ? Why not early before ? Hmm...
There's dirt in the middle
"Better place? Is that you're talking about the unborn child with Britney, that's now in heaven?"
Baby terminator
"Not only did he force Britney Spears to have an abortion, bad boy Justin Timberlake also ""cuckolded"" the Pop princess while they were dating."
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I wish they'd do another album or at least re record some of their old hits like Taylor
"what you did to Britney is unnacceptable, coward"
"Dear Justin, i hope you disapear and we never have to see you, or hear you, you are a terrible person, you envy and jelousy brought you this."
Stay with *NSYNC
I like NSYNC minus Justin.
i thought the lines distribution would  be a bit fairer in 2023 but it was just Justin and JC. but no doubt its a fabulous song.

"Britney Spears 😢😢
Justin Timberlake 🤢🤮"
This was more important than your unborn child         sure
Sooo... Due to Britney you killed your own child JT
Ekelhaft von justin timberlake dass er sich für ne Abtreibung ausgesprochen hat.weil sie zu jung waren etc..du wars geld und ruhmgierig.männer die ne abtreibung vorschlagen um es noch nett zu sagen sollen mal nachdenken wo viele millionen männer wären wenn frauen obwohl sie jung sind im stich gelassen werden vom partner etc nicht abtreiben weil sie nicht so schnell aufgeben wie männer.schämt euch alle.
"Say sorry to Britney, Justin!!!"
JCs voice omg😢
"My Legend, My Heroes🤘🏻 i love you Nsync"
Glad to see NSYNC  back together
Justin timberlake you did the abortion with britneys pregnancy... may god bless your soul
🤢
Ew p00per man
"Justin would never reunite with these guys if THEY wanted it, only because HE needs to do damage control of his own image."
"Wish we could’ve heard more of the band..but, better than nothing lol"
Você é um covarde!
"El camino al ""abismo"" esta lleno de buenas intenciones.

Thanks Lou 👊...

Yaye! *NSYNC there was a fire that sparked in me last week!! Tiny desk?😅
A bailar !!! Saludos desde Santiago de Chile 🌷🇨🇱🌷
I was having a pretty bad day and then I heard this song and It motivated me to try again
Sorry but BSB fan forever!! 😝
I love it!
I was a BSB girl but oh my god if *NSYNC releases an album and/or go on tour? I’d hop online to buy tickets no hesitation
Yessss
"LOL, they appear to be in their 50's."
👇 botão de quem voltou na infância.
"Wow, this song has me feeling so nostalgic! 😍💫 It's like a trip down memory lane to my childhood all over again. Their harmonies are still on point, and the energy in this track is just infectious!"
I completely didn’t recognize JC in this picture…
"The nostalgia hits hard but the lyrics 🎯 with a world spinning out of control, their music  takes us to a better place. A moment to rise above our troubles and bask in the sun with them."
You don't deserve them Justin.
I'm so excited to see y'all together.🎉🎉🎉
Love this beautiful together again we need music for the soul in this crazy world we need some positivity thank you for sharing your gift again Appreciate you Always 🫶🏻🦋

Will need to do  live video to get the views. @justintimberlake
Eso es una canción de Justin coN NSYNC ....el que entendió entendió
AWESOMENESS!!!!!
Amazing ❤❤❤
😅even the picture is all about justin… all microphones on him😅… the song would be better without so much auto tune and a little less justin.
"Omg,I'm so excited about this song,Justin and JC sounds like if they are still teens, real harmony by the whole group,I love you guys ,hope to hear more from you guys"
You guys heal my ears.. I'm feeling good with this song
thanks NSYNC for this... wao
crazy how the male face filters make them look worse

I csn definitely tell who wrote this.  JT doesn't get enough credit for his amazing song writing.
"meanwhile, dctalk cant even do this... :-("
No have music video ? I love this song so much ❤
"I've listened to this so many times it's criminal. 

Hey Heyyyy
Why, why, why?
Why why?
Oh, oh

You're killin us tonight
you're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
hey fellas, cmon.
We loved you endlessly
no BSB wasn't for me
So now it's time to tour
don't leave us alone

I know that we can't take no more 
it ain't no lie
We wanna see you on that tour
fellas, why why why?! 
why, why?

We wanna be fools for you
just perform for a night or two
You may be busy but it aint no lie
Fellas, why why why? 

Don't really wanna make it tough
we just wanna tell you we can't enough
It might sound crazy
but it ain't no lie
fellas, why why why? 

Just hit us with the truth
now, boys you're more than welcome to
so give us one good reason, fellas cmon.

We pined for you not bsb
since two thousand and three
and now I really come to see
That life would be much better
once you're on

We know that we can't take no more
it ain't no lie
we wanna see you on that tour
fellas why why why"
Oh God....my ears😡
Fuck yeah NSYNC reunion
Definitely this is my favorite song by far this year .. it's a triumph comeback now. 😊😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Surtando em 3 2 1 😮
"🕺❤💃 
I was sad the day they disbanded.  😢"
I am a HUGE *NSYNC fan and super excited by them reuniting but this song is not great 😬🙈 cue the hate comments 😂
❤
Wait a minute! this is a banger. Takes me back to my childhood days.
Great song.  Great idea JT
"Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's some kind of love, it's some kind of fire

We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ooh, oh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You like the bass down low, I wanna lose control
I wanna dance all night, you like it nice and slow
Don't want it any other way, tell all your friends you're gonna stay
When we're together, you know that we do it better

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves are gettin' stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster, faster

I like to see you lose control
(Ain't nobody better, we do it better)
I know a place, say that you'll go with me, yeah

Yes yes yes ❤🎉🎉❤
❤❤❤❤❤
"Awww I missed my guys 🥹 This is such a great song to get from them after all these years. They defined my early teenage years~ I never got to see them in concert, but I'm so happy they finally hooked back up for this. I couldn't ask for more."
Everybody listen so this can become a huge hit and they will be forced to make more music and tour lmao

Welcome Back Golden Pop Hands

Nice 💕💕
Guess my nickname tells everything. 😏
vamooo porrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉
"America needs this kind of music, energy, and unity especially right fuckin now."
They really have always done it better than anything  yes I'm crying  we demand a tour
Justin was smart enough to realize that he wasn't relevant anymore and didn't have any other option than join them  again lol
My new jam! I feel 20 years old again!
"Actually as a *NSYNC fan when they was together during my teen years, this is awkward. I don’t know but just the way they broke up. This song is ok. But I wish them well."
So beautiful 🎶🎶🎶🎶
Even though I am now 36 years old the thought of them getting back together doing an album and going on tour makes me want to get up and scream my fucking head off like I am the 12 year old little girl that was obsessed with the band years and years and years ago and hop and jump and scream and everything else in between but I'm not twelve years old anymore so I will not and say I did
"Oh my❣️🔥
Keep going❣️
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥✨"
Loving this. Wanting more!!
we loved you so much NSYNC  i used to listen to you when iam at work YOU MADE MY DAYS   NOW IAM RETIRED BUT STILL LISTENING TO YOUR SONGS AT MORNING -----
The talent is still there!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE ITTT
I wish they would go on a reunion tour <3
Wow I am loving this song. They came back strong. Go ahead aye
I guess the other guys will never get a solo 😭😭😭
"❤Welcome back, *NSYNC! Great song with beautiful vocals!"
*NSYNC finally back together - suddenly the world feels right again. ❤
"This is addictive! heard it today on Sirius XM, so far I've played it 6 times in two hours at work! LOUD!"
"it's clear they've all aged, but i love that jc is the only one i did not recognize at first. this is crazy. what a bop"
Please come back
Why does it reads Justin Timberlake and Nsync when I downloaded the track 🤔isn't he still part of the group 😳
Just want to say a big thank you to justin for reunited everyone back together you brought our childhood fun back
Words are useless.. ❤❤❤❤❤
♥️👸🏼💎🌌🦚🦋🌻
Better place means dead and now in heaven.
Their voices still sounds amazing. Love JC voice as always 💜
It is so good to hear them together again 🙌🏻💜
The nostalgia is real!! I would love to see a reunion tour!! As a child NSYNC was my favorite band. I regret I was not old enough to be able to make it to a concert back when they last toured.
"I am screaming . Im 37 and i have all these emotions just like i was 12
Edit: like i still listen to the *NSYNC ( self titled ) album , I’ve got all the physical CD’s and in digital ,"
You can hear Cris' voice very clear @2:00 and Joey's @2:10
Definitely sounds very K pop ish
Merecemos um comeback
We need a Verzuz. BACKSTREET BOYS VS NSYNC
dude I wish they would stay together forever
Amazing song
It's amazing. I told u.. 🙂👍 Sounds good to hear the harmony again
Iuu
Was never a boy band fan until BTS. But I like this song!
Até arrepiei!!!!!! Muito boa!!! ❤😍😍
Not a good song... sorry 😢
Tour dates please NSYNC. Love the new song. You guys are awesome together.❤❤❤❤❤
FINALLY ❤🙌🏼🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🎧👑👑👑👑
❤️🔥❤️
"So do Lance, Joey and Chris finally have solo parts in the song? I can't figure out who sings which part, I recognize JC's voice, and Justin's voice on the chorus."
✌️✌️✌️ go N’Sync!! ✌️✌️✌️
LO MEJOR¡
Only reason for union is because of new trolls movie
Omg!!! My boy band lol literally still listen to them to this day. 😭😭😭 freaking out rn
"I heard Justin and a bit of JC, didn't hear N'SYNC, is it just me?"
My favorite boy bans besides N.K.O.T.B. I 💗 N Sync since childhood
👈🏾🎶NOT BAD🎶👉🏾
🎉beep bopping 🎧🎶🎵
🎉beep bopping 🎧🎶🎵
It’s giving a little dua lipa with the music and I like it! Saw these guys in 1999 when I was 19! Me and my girls from college made tank tops and painted the rock (which a big deal at UTK!) 😂😂😂 then they went to an after party at a club where Justin and lance stayed in the dj booth! Such a fun night!
Imagine if JT decided to make nsync tour the country and bring bsb as their openers?!?!?!
NSYNC back together for one song makes me incredibly happy! Better place is such a bop. I really hope they have more in store for us or more plans up their sleeves.
"YAWN. Musically, this is even less interesting than the original NSYNC songs back then. Otherwise, as well."
"Good song, but feels reserved. This song feels like trying to appeal to fans, not trying to be who you guys really are, your trying to be what you think people would like, not who you really are which could be out of this world amazing, but your afraid to take the risk cause it could backfire. This reminds me of maroon 5 or something."
I want a music video for this so bad! I love this song already.
"I have a 25 year old son who is a singer. He has loved NSYNC since he was a kid. My other son is autistic and doesn’t speak. He doesn’t like music because it’s too much for his ears. He covers them, but one day, we caught him listening to NSYNC and smiling. He watched the whole NSYNC concert with a big smile."
My babies are back together. Love this song.
Yes this is exciting for all shapes of NSYNC fans lol these dudes should of done Super Bowl instead of usher no offense
JC’s tone is soooooooooooooo pretty wow! That’s what it is! 😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
Love it I wonder if this is the one they did for the new Trolls movie 💛💛
So beautiful amazing ❤
Goosebumps 😢❤
Could be even greater to hear this song just before the summer :)
If this wasn’t produced by a say so producer or wasn’t sampled from say so I will be shocked if neither is true.
What a great comeback!😢
I will always love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You don't whistle anymore enuff
"Shout out NSYNC, I guess."
Welcome back nsync it's been a while ❤❤❤❤
Hmm............I don't know how I feel about it.
I wish Nick Carter and JC fans would stop tearing down Justin's solo success. They had their chance at a solo career but it didn't work out.
Get back together
OMG 💜💜💜💜💜
"Un puto album completo, Justin, no solo una canción!!! Nos lo merecemos!!!"
Been waiting a long time cheers this is awesome
Omg is it real😭😭
"It's crazy,JC is been always the best nsync voice, and Justin gets the credit,Justin timberlake channel?really, should be nsync channel,not Justin timberlake channel"
AWESOME.
"If N*SYNC did a video that is somewhat is a homage to Mary J. Blige and George Michael's As video with this song, where it's very clean, chill, with dance moves but shows they are in a whole other place in their lives as the men they are now but can really enjoy having a good time party, that would be a very video. Some laughs. Some fun. But looking dapper at the same time. Maybe a couple of cameos...not to say JT is even looking at this remark...but, there's a vision."
I’m not feeling it sorry!
Make itcolour code text pls . Love it 🥰
I love this
The best thing that happened for this year ❤❤❤❤❤ since I have been waiting for long time 😭😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤
Galera com mais de 30 surtando 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

"I need more Lance, Joey & Chris."
⭐️Nsync forever ❤️🔥
Quero clipeeeee
It's nice to hear JC and JT together again
Should of just posted it on the group page.. the song would of been more successful on Youtube and would be trending higher..
Love band but Jesus Christ is only way ❤
❤❤grew up listening to NSYNC!!🎉🎉
Great song!!!!!
A breath of fresh air from the absolute garbage that's been in the so called music charts for the last 15 years 👍😊
JC Delivered!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Hearing this … 5 of them…. Took me in my better Place!!! Yoo Hoo!!!❤️❤️❤️
Hell yea!! Love it!! About time lol 🫶🏼🫶🏼
"You can come up with something edgier 😕
You have it in you guys. Go funk, go blues.  You're not producing music for preteens anymore.  If you're going to do this again you might as well start singing Elvis or Beatles songs; at least those are classics"
백스트리즈 보이즈 곡이 더 좋네
"Beautiful song! Glad to see you together again, guys! ♥"
"Rendida a los pues del Rey JT que lograi esto. Reunir a sus ex compañeros,  hacer su arte increible y llenarnos de felicidad.  JT un Dios"

Hmmm... Okay 😒
So excited❤ awesome!!!
Hammer 🎉❤
Jt and 4 bums
"Wow! This is superb! After waiting for more than two decades we have a new cool song from the Legendary NSYSC. This song takes me back to my good old teenage days. Gosh! Some of my favourite include:
It Makes Me ill
Bye Bye
It's Gonna Be Me
Thank God it's Friday
Pop
Celebrity
Just Don't Tell Me That
Gone
Just the Two of Us
Selfish 
Tell me Tell Me Baby
That Girl Will Never Mine"
My 12 year old self is so happy the boys are back. I’m still madly in love with Justin and JC.
THIS MUSIC IS SO EPIC 😍
OMG! Estou em choque com isso 🤯🤩 Muita feliz em ver vocês reunidos novamente 😍😍😍
Insert is back
My whole life is complete!!
The underlying harmonization of the boys is impeccable. This version is best for the movie but I do wish they made a version of this where we can hear all their voices. That will shut up the haters here. 👏🏼😂🎉
I love JC ♡ ❤️
Not going to lie. I wasn't keen on nsync or backstreet boys back in the mid and late 90s. Actually I did liked a few of their songs back in the early 00s in the gay clubs back home in Manchester England. But then they grew on me especially Justin when he went solo. I actually so like this song. Lol
❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
OMG! N*SYNC is back! Uncle Lance and Uncle Justin still look good 😄
"Thank you Justin, JC, Joey, Chris and Lance for bringing *NSYNC back 😊"
Nsync forever. Ot5 ftw!🎉❤
❤❤❤
Love it! Been a fan since I was 10 and I'm 36 now
??? NSYNC???
Love you JT 🙌🩷
I wish they replaced the whistling with another noise. I can’t stand it. After that part it’s a cute song. Lol. Hope to hear more music.
JC!! ❤
"Chris could sing here with his high pitched voice, Justin. I mean, why not give Joye 2 lines to sing?"
"This is the new Justin single, since he didnt have a hit the last years. The NSYNC reform is a Justin move, i like the song."
Berasa denger lagunya Jonas Brother :D
It's like they never broke up and picked up exactly where they left off.  They are so N SYNC!
Can't wait for the MV and Choreography
Never stop never stopping!
❤❤❤
Welcome Back ✨NSYNC ❤❤❤❤❤
Love 😘❤ Proud 😘❤️🔥💎🦁🤟
Justin 🙋‍♂️👍
It’s amazing 😊❤
JC ❤❤❤❤❤ wowowowowow!!!!
Nsync Back again ❤
"Suddenly I playing with my fingers and moved my head from left to right, right to left."
Love it!! ❤
My kings are back! I'm really hoping for another album from the boys. They clearly still have the vocals.
"No hace ni dos meses que me puse a ver videos de la banda (soy fan de BsB de toda la  vida) y Dios mío, de qué me había perdido. Y mira nomás que sacan nueva canción, si esto no es manifestar no sé qué es XD."
yay!
🍂🍁💃✌️🍂🍁💃🌹luv this 🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
"My kings are back!!! \o/ After all of this time they nailed it again! Time didn't change a thing - they're all gorgeous and talented still; they're just like fine wine 😍 and yeah, as the song says, I'm really excited guys, thank u for that ❤️🥲 Omg, my childhood is back. I feel like a child again! We're back to the early 2000s, bitches! \o/ 😍🥲❤️ geez, I'm so emotional right now... ❤️🥲"
"I am so excited to hear from this group again, I'm putting my savings aside for the tour release dates ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
This makes my heart happy
When’s the music video?
... worst song I ever heard in 20+ years.. I do not approve this
Simply monumental 🔥 Been a huge *NSYNC fan since they came out and still is a huge fan up until now. This is the band that made me wanna become an entertainer myself and I'm so thankful that they are back together after years and years of waiting. *NSYNC fever lives on. 🔥🔥🔥
Is this the song that will be in the new Trolls movie?
Demasiado para la vida 🎉
This was amazing!! Love hearing the band back together ❤
I love this song so much!!!*NSYNC being back makes me soooo happy!! ♥️♥️♥️ I’d love a new NSYNC album and tour! 🫶
*NSYNC is back!
Treasured
I just want a tour!❤🎉🎉
Omg yes!!!!!!! Imagine cry happy tears I grew up to you guys
This sounds like they just picked up where they left off. Music doesn’t sound like this anymore. And I’m so sorry but Justin doing high pitched vocals is so annoying. I do like the beat tho. Maybe it’ll grow on me.
THIS SONG IS SO FUNNNNN
"dayummmm im literally crying 😭😭 thank u for this special gift, seing u all
getting back together and reeasing a single after so many years it's a dream comes true for all of ur fans 😭❤"
Jesus Christ they all look so old. Lance looks so awkward. Justin looks alright.
NSYNC  nuevamente reunido 😢❤❤
"Yaaaaas! My teen years came rushing back! The No Strings Attached Tour was my first concert ever! Chile, I had the dolls, shirts, posters, candy, watch, and boardgame. If they actually go on a reunion tour......I'm Done!!!!!!!🤣🤣 Please make the reunion tour happen.👐🏾"
On repeat ALL DAY!!!!!
"nsync regreso con todo , excelente cancion"

"Good vibes!

Who’s idea was it to do this song together? I love everything NSYNC ❤❤❤. My kids love Trolls so much too!  Come on November and if a concert is in the future bring that on too. All of your voices are wonderful!  Thank you so much. 🎉  I hope you had fun singing this song together.
I’m definitely in a “better place” now after hearing this 🤍
"Ok I listened to this on, Trolls lyric video and *NSYNC’s channel so why not on JT’s too… let’s see which one gets the most views!"
Amazing song!  Chills!!  Chills everywhere!!
"Welcome back, boys!"
"All these years, and the other 3 still don't have lines lmfao. Glad to hear you boys again tho, was just jamming to some classics the other night."
"God damn...first Big Time Rush, then the Jonas Brothers, and now *NSYNC.  My younger self is healing and thriving!!"
Congratulations and Welcime back Justin
Is this an NSYNC song or Justin's song  :(
Wow this is surreal!! 🎉 I’m definitely excited ❤❤❤❤❤❤
"All those years, and now NSYNC's New Song for 2023. NSYNC is back and alive."
I love it ❤
"Welcome back, boys. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
"Even though I have not heard Nsync much before - maybe hyst bye bye song, it's actually very catchy and banger.

Well done!"
Amazing pop song! Great to see NSYNC back together! Can't wait for more new songs!

Ooooooh myyyyy gooood! 🙉😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
"All these comebacks as of late. Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Timbaland, Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake etc. and now Justin brings N-SYNC back. What a time to be a music fan"
They didn' t age that well... :S
This made my damn day! Was a massive fan since their MTV TRL days. This hits home.
Not bad surprisingly
We need live performance ASAP! My 7 year old self is dying to go to a reunion tour or even just one night concert is fine
Goosebumps all around! *NSYNC is my go to karaoke!
Wake me up!!! Its a dream???
Awesome ❤
Taylor Swift collab when? 😍
"*After more than 20 years, NSYNC is back and with a new song.*"

0:05 it’s giving DILF 0:13
"I cried instantly, I've loved NSYNC since i was 12. My heart literally went to my butt when I saw Chris Kirkpatrick at river fest in Watertown Wisconsin. Thank you so much for this song. Love you so much ❤"
Hahaha cantan 2 y los otros son solo coro
"This is AWESOME....seems like it should be in a broadway play....

Awful nsync song.
WOW The BEST VOICES.!  NSYNC FOR EVER ❤
😍
"Oh my God , i’m crying 😭😭😭😭"
*NSYNC bringing pop back 🎊 🎉
"Love the song, guys. Glad you got back together to do this! 💕"
I thought it was president zelensky at first
Ima be honest... this was mid.
Who wrote this?
"No sé por qué me recordó un poco a los Jonas Brothers, pero funciona. Me gustó 🫶"
"Omg! This is so cool! NSYNC was my first concert and all three CDs I had to buy a few times because I wore them out. Even now, when I hear an NSYNC song playing at like a grocery store, I STILL think it sounds so good. 20 years later. I STILL like it. You guys look great! And this is a great first come back song. Just like before, I find my head bobbin along to the catchy tune. Thanks for being a part of SO MANY teen memories for me and I'd love to see you guys have success in my adulthood. If there's an album, I'll surely buy it!! Fan for life!"
"*NSYNC, the world thanks you sincerely and genuinely from the bottom of our hearts.💕"
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 YASSSSSSS
Música boa para ouvir no carro🇧🇷
I am so happy ❤❤❤ 😭😭😭😭
this is real music
"I'm so excited for the new Trolls Movie!!! And hopefully a tour, we need more *NSYNC"
Its about damn time 🙌🏾 time to run it up again 🤑🤑🤑
Welcome back ❤❤❤❤❤
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN FROM BLACK GIRL STEPHANIE COLUMBUS OHIO FOREVER LOVE YOU ALL❤❤❤❤❤1982
❤
Cool Peace Love RFS Israel *.
This is just genius to make this part of Trolls franchise. Talk about knowing and loving your audience. All of those girls that loved them decades ago are now moms that love them with their kids. Old + new demo unlocked. Brilliant marketing!
More music NSYNC
I love this!!❤❤❤ I would go nuts for a new album! After almost 30 years I still love your guys music and listen to it every day! Thank you for the new song!
"With all this trash in this days, this its a fresh air of past, congratulations."
Adulting has been so hard. This is everything right now. JC ❤😂
❤❤❤🎉
"So proud of these young men. No egos, no drama; all love and respect. That's how you stay NSync."
"I don't hear much of Chris, Lance or Joey vocals in this track. Usually NSYNC is a really good blend. Plus, you're all in your 40s or older so i can't expect the same sound from the 90s. Still pretty good though. When's the 2023 album coming out?"
LEGENDS
Listening to these guys again is spectacular. I spent the best years of my life enjoying the good music of these guys.
I'm here for this!!!! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
They still got it. What a happy song 😊
I feel like a teenager again. I love you guys so much❤❤❤❤❤
Im loving this so much!!
100% 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
eles estão de volta uhuulll
"It's a pretty good song, but I'm not really feeling an NSYNC vibe on this one. It sounds like a JT song that features JC. I was really hoping to hear more of that NSYNC blend or at least be able to identify everyone's voices. In any event, good song. Love seeing everyone together again. Hoping for more collaboration in the future that'll let us hear what a mature NSYNC could sound like."
Jc is the cute one now 😳😳😳
*Here in Mexico its on every radio sation right now.*
"Justo still looks the same, and AJ went from young daddy to DILFDILFDILFDILF ❤"
"Justo still looks the same, and AJ went from young daddy to DILFDILFDILFDILF ❤"
"Regardless your taste in music, it’s good to hear a new Nsync song again. Great to have you back gentlemen."
Lol its not nsync style and i hear Jt all over the music
Thank you guys!.
I'm not a fan but I'm also a backstreet girl! I just can't believe this is the best they can do after soooo many years 😮
"so looking forward to watch the new trolls, the whole idea behind the movie seems to have been to reunite these guys back. Just love it, we need more songs that just bring you joy :)"
"Im a young Nsync fan. I wasn't alive when they were the best thing around. I find it incredible that I get to be a part of history with this song, and getting the opertunity to hear a new Nsync release"
You have taken us to a Better Place!!! Amazing song!!!
Omg I can’t im in love with this song
Yay!!!!! Finally!!! So happy to have new music from N'Sync. Loved them then....love them still. Good talent never gets old....love you guys!!!!
Non ne sbagliano una..vi adoro❤
WOOOOO
"The first new song released in over 20 years was worth the wait.  NSYNC has done it again, way to go guys. I absolutely love it"
Yahushua the messiah son of Yahweh is the ONLY hope of salvation
Love this 💕 so happy they are back. They better go on Tour I'm spending every dime. 22 years too long
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
I was just wondering the other day where Justin has been. This is a nice surprise from all of them though.
NSYNC FANS..... This is what we've been waiting for... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is just another Trolls song starring Justin Timberlake lmao
"Getting some Miami Horror vibes from this , love it!"
"Looking back in 90s feels like 14 yers old again, NSYNC one of the greatest boyband."
Genial ❤
"As a more BSB fan, happy for all the Nsync die hards. They've been waiting for this for decades. I hope all of Nsync rides it until the end. Even if Justin goes back solo, he should save half of his concert for Nsync."
"Y’all, I am Emotional!!! Hearing these boys together in 2023 makes my heart happyyyyy🥰"
WE WANT TOUR
"Strategically, this song is a week or 2 late. There was so much hype for the group, and a weird wait.... If this came out 2 weeks ago with the hype, it would have over a million+ views already. I do really like the song!"
"Repeat. Repeat, motherfucking repeat!"
Yay 😊❤🎉
"Congrats  guys 🎉
My favorite childhood band 🤗"
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m so happy my guys are back together 😊 I can’t wait to see what else is in store. I’ll never stop lovin’ you ❤
JC!!!!!! I smiled so big hearing him in the 2nd verse 😭❤️❤️
I swear I manifested *NSYNC’s reunion ! 😊😊😊
"Very beautiful video thank you for
 sharing my friend, The way you do the work gracefully
 - I am very proud of you. Thanks for going through 
the trouble and it's worth it.  I’ve never witnessed 
such awesome editing as this one. You have
 the absolute power to rise above any situation
 or struggle and transform yourself 
into the strongest and most beautiful 
version of yourself ever. The secret
 to happiness is doing what you love
 and learning to love what you have to do to get it. 
Congratulations and best of luck for your promising future. 
Keep doing the best work. Great job, you are amazing,

When NSYNC becomes Justin Timberlake
"I'm so EXCITED and touched to see N'SYNC, My early childhood band back again. I wish Dad was here to see this.🎉😅"
Gracias por el reencuetro tan esperado por los que los Amamos 'NSYNC!!!! 🎤🎶🎶🎶👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
I'm just going to keep saying THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Better Place is really good! Great job on putting together another hit. Here's to more catchy music in the future from *NSYNC!
❤❤❤👏👏
:O
"This sounds and looks like a reunion party nobody in the band had asked for besides JT, and maybe a curious JC, but every fan of the 90s and 00s are over the moon about."
Amazing to hear the whole group again. Chill vibe is what I need right now
"Please, I just need one more album! Just one! Also a tour, with the possibility of more, plus another album…also I love *NSYNC."
Amazing brings back so many memories ❤ I love it you guys are awesome keep them coming dont tease us😊
This is so good! Thank you! Nice to make it for the new Trolls movie because those films are so surprisingly fun! (I can see this being an opening song in a show!) Yall voices still sound so good together!
Thanks for giving us poor Millennials something to be excited about 🎉😊
Best boy band period!
We need a video asap!!!
"And just like that, they're back. Welcome back, boys. 🔥🔥❤❤😍😍"
🥹🥹🥹

JC still sings great
The blending of their voices are still gorgeous..
Will look for them on trolls movie. They made this song for the morning
Is this an NSync or Justin Timberlake single? LOL
All I hear is Justin and Jc.
So amazing thank you guys so much for putting this out . We miss you guys tons!!!
*NSYNC 🇧🇷  2023 esperamos esse momento a anos 🎶 muito bom  viver isso novamente depois de 20 anos 🙏
Worth the wait! Shared this with my girls today and they already love it too.
That picture is horrible of them I loved them in the late 90s to the 2000s
Sheeesh
"I have been a huge fan of N*sync since late 90's but... This is a no for me. Truly was expecting something different, this sound ""generic""."
2:55
😮😮omgosh they coming back?????
"We need a tour, a Latin America Tour 💕🥲"
Amazing to have the boys back!!!
That was really good they sound great
Yesss
Love it. Need an Nsync reunion tour.
I like it
Hagan una gira por latinoamericana por favor 🙏🏼 22 años esperando esto
"Ahh lindos, ameii a música , amei a volta de vocês 🥰😍❤❤❤❤❤"
Now drop the music video! 😆😆❤️
"I love , soy fan desde bebé ❤ me encantannnn , saludos desde Nicaragua 😘"
NSYNC IS BACK!
"So ecxited for this! Its another amazing song, from my absolute favorite group! Love that my 5yr old is just as excited as I am and i can share this with her!"
Yes verry nice .Endlich da geht noch etwas . Daumen hoch 🙂
Auto tuned the entire song. So not feeling it
"Why can't there be more people like me. Back in the day, I knew the boys were better , but I didn't hated, still don't hate NSYNC"
Magic is created when you 5 get together. Seems like those 21 years never passed by. Your connection is there. You are good on your own but great together. Thanks for this amazing gift!
Did I just cry? Yes
Just heard this on the radio 📻 didn't believe it at first 😳 Welcome back this Era needed fresh music 🎼🎶🎵🎤🎧
Very NSYNC and very BTS at the same time. But JC was held back with Justin singing too much again. First verse and pre chorus was the usual format between the two. The second verse and pre chorus ….Justin took part of the second verse? Why? And where are the harmonies?
this is garbage
❤❤❤!!!
"I'm autistic and have ADHD and this song hit me in a spot that had me shaking, goosebumps, hands flapping crying, laughing, and generally feeling amazing. This is such a good song. I've had it on repeat all freaking day!!!! Please keep creating together. You guys are amazing!!!"
I am so in love!!! 🥰❤️💗💕 I am the #1 N*SYNC fan!!
Where is the music video boys?
So does anyone feel like us 30 somethings needed to be inspired again..all of the bad things going on in the world we can rememeber the good ol days..I literally felt happiness n joy listening to do this!!
This is amazing! Love the song can't wait to hear more! Now I have something good to listen to at work today love it! 😎✌️ thank yall for this amazing song!
Loveeee it! Music video please! I need it!
2:01 2:03 2:05  are just my favorite parts even the whole song omg it feels like I’m non existing
This song is AMAZING!!! ❤ has that classic Nsync feel! So glad to see you guys back together!
Não estou acreditando que estou vivenciando isso 😭♥️😭♥️😭♥️
When is the new NSYNC concert gonna be? Its gonna be Maayy😂!!!
I'm obsessed!! Tears!! Yay yay yay
They need to release an album and do a tour!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful job
OMG! I know I'm older now but I was such a nsync fan. Had nsync everything.  Brings back so many memories.  My mom made sure to send me trolls 3 preview
Talk about nostalgia🔥🔥🔥
Y'all look beautiful in this photoshoot
Holy shit JC's voice is amazing. GREAT JOB J YOU & THE GUYS DID AMAZING
Now it makes sense why everyone freaked out at Joey when he made the comment about being in a “better place” on Hot Ones.
What the hell 😂 history’s being made here
"If we cant get a tour, i hate to even say that, can we atleast get more music, more albums?? U guys are great at what u do, i dont know why u guys stopped making albums when u did .. 😭 but we need more!! I need more music to add to my playlist!! This is a great start!! Keep it coming!! 🥰"
This is the best day of my life. I have been waiting 23 years for this. Please go on tour.
NO LO PUEDO CREER
I’m SO love with this song! It’s been SO long and have dreamt about this day for 23 years!
The first ad that came up on this video was a transphobic Epoch Times advertisement.  Not a good look for this artist.
New album is what we need
"Love it
Remix with a female r&b singer please!!!"
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Been listening to this all day! I am so in awe! Just brings back memories!❤
"My girls (and me) have been reliving their childhood since they reunited.  It brings back so many wonderful memories and smiles.  Thanks, NSYNC!"
Love it!
Love it! Thank you guys!
Einmal fan immer Fan for ever ♥️
Let's get all of the guys to shine on a new *Nsync albu.! Joey has a great voice and talent would love to hear more from them. May I suggest a non instrumental Acapella/beatboxing album? If anyone can pull it off it's *Nsync!
FINALLY
Pero solo canta Justin? Esto es como las pussycat dolls😂
Brabo brabo brabo
That's crazy we have a reunion 😮😮😮
"Thank you so much for this!  It is absolutely amazing.  I've been listening on repeat all day!  I can't express the feelings I had hearing all 5 of you back together on a new song...all, just all.  So much joy today!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I truly hope this isn't all we are going to get from y'all!"
Screaming for joy at this song. It's so amazing; thank you guys so much!!!!
🎉🎉🎉
I’m so happy right now. Thank you! 🫶✨
Freaking AWESOME
Put me out of my misery and tell me if there’s no possibility of an official reunion and tour.
Im so happy listening to this 😊❤
Justin con el corito de 4 de  siempre😂
Cuántos años esperando que se reúnan de nuevo🥺🥺🥺😭

"I never thought I would say this, but this kind of music from when we were kids/teens is much better than what we've been hearing for the past few decades."
Nice to hear JC… really makes it feel like an *NSYNC song rather than a JT solo album
"Cannot stop dancing to this song!!!
I loved it ❤️
And so happy to hear JC singing!!!
His voice is amazing 🎵❤️"
Justin originally produced this for himself but decided to share it with the rest of the group. It’s obvious once u see the lil video of them recording it. I love it! It’s just great to hear them singing together again.
"I thought this wasn't real. I'm suddenly taken back to the age of 13, listening to my CD player in class or on the bus. Such nostalgia. Well done Lads.  I can't wait to show my kiddos. Welcome back."
"Awesome 👍
The Boys Are On Fire 🔥"
I love them ❤❤❤
"I adore you Justin, but it's wonderful to see the group that made me so happy when I was younger united. Love to NSYNC forever"
Love this!! Something that I can dance too!!
"Made me smile from ear to ear😄total🔥my new jam, it's like time stood still, I have will and forever be a true fan❤️you so much guys, I hope you as brothers unite come together for another album/tour,that would be like a dream and the best gift ever🤞🤗#NSYNC4LIFE"
Damn it's JT and JC all over again.
Omgggggg .... ❤❤❤❤ grown men voices ... && I loveeee it!!!
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥
Been humming the 40 second version for weeks. It's nice to learn the rest lol
"La razón por la que quise aprender inglés, amo sus canciones y a ustedes por siempre, ❤"
"I want more joey, Chris and lance!!"
"I love yours songs and this boys forever, ❤"
"JCs runs still send a shiver down my spine, Lance's bass vocals completely MAKE the chorus, and hearing the vocalizations and adlibs just makes my inner 14 year old smile. Thank you for this gift, cannot WAIT to continue to the ride with yall! *NSYNC FOREVER!!!!!"
pure magic!!!!!
Finally ❤
Oh my childhood has just come back ❤
Over the moon with this!
"If my grandpa were still alive, he'd wait overnight to get me tickets! He used to wake me up at 4am and lineup infront of Sam Goody to get my 'NSYNC Xmas album because the first 100 in line got a limited edition ornament, lol. RIP Grandpa ❤"
"😭 Maaaaaan, i lived to listen / see this, thank you guys!! FINALLY! The days of waiting is over, now... Give us the world tour already! 🇧🇷😊👍🏾"
❤
"Alguien mas se puso a escuchar todo el repertorio de NSYNC desde que escucho la canción en la mañana, y ahora la esta volviendo a escuchar nuevamente, esta sensación es INCREÍBLE!!!"
Love this. We've been waiting to hear you all together again ❤❤
I love it! Thank you guys so much for doing this for us! I hope to see more from you guys in the future! ❤❤❤ #NsyncBetterPlace #NsyncFanForever
Going back to the good old days ❤❤❤
"I still have ""Sailing"" in my playlist, after all these years. Really happy for you guys, hearing you still produce stuff together. That is quite unexpected!"
"I have listened to this 5,000 times"
"THEY'RE COMING BACK !!!!!

I'm so glad they are back.
Wow wasn't expecting this! Love the song!
OBRIGADO MEUS AMIGOS !!!!
"*Never thought I would EVER hear these amazing voices together again,,, I cried so hard its not even funny!!! x0x0x*"
All I can hear is Justin and JC it seems like the other 3 got the shaft for this song.
I always have been their fan.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO PUEDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Aye this is a bop
"It's good, but it sounds like Don't Start Now mixed with every K-Pop group in the world right now.

Nice to see them back regardless. This will do great on the charts."
Nice..back in time...👍🫶
Taylor had a feeling!!
Yes….But kind of wish this was release during the summer . A great jam either way 😎♥️😊!!!!!

Nailed it! This is just what the world needed! 😊
Time has nothing on these iconic guys!! Kudos to *NSYNC! Love this! Speechless
The emotions I'm going through! I never thought I'd ever hear a new NSYNC song EVER. I truly hope they go on tour for us! I saw them twice back in the day but I'd love to see them again. NSYNC made my teen years so much easier.
OMG!I lovd it! It seems like no time has passed. I feel like I was in the nineties when I was a teenager with all my favorite boy bands active.
❤
"OH heck YES, my boys are BACK 
Its sooooo good to hear them together again after so many years. They still sound so *NSYNC
LOL 😅 Welcome back 💖💖💖💖"

Welcome back NSYNC
Yasssss!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ perfect 👌thank NsyNc
🫶🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💚
"Why does it sound like a Maroon 5 song? The beat, the structure, JT's falsetto screams so Adam Levine from It Wont be Soon Before Long era 😅"
The band back together is 🔥🔥🔥
Love it! My kids and I are already dancing all over the house to our new favorite jam!!!
"My boys 🥰🥰🥰🥰 I've  been waiting over 20 years for this ,and I am not disappointed . GREAT SONG 💃💃💃💃💃"
This is what we all needed to hear ! ❤ thank you for giving us this song. Hope we get a reunion concert 🎉
"It's the Justin Timberlake part for me 😂❤ but the song sounds like ,, Say so "" from Doja Cat...the song from Nsync is not bad but nothing special to be honest...it's not a song I would listen to everyday....😅"
🥲 FINALLY 🙌🏽
"Chicas de latinoamerica, hay que seguir reproduciendo para que vean nuestro apoyo!!
Nsync Foverer ❤"
So excited!!! We’ve been waiting for the stars to align and it fall into place!!!!! ❤

"IM SO EXCITED!!! Released the day after my 33rd birthday!!! OVER THE MOON!!! Thank You, Gentlemen!!!"
"Man, this was a cathartic experience. Like a hug from my 12 year old self."
"You guys should release an ALL HITS ALBUM, which could include 4/5 brand-new songs. Kind of killing 2 birds with one stone. 

1. New music-ish... Why not? 2. Satisfy a lot of fans who have been looking forward to ""something"" from you guys! 

Of course, that's just my opinion. 

Much love!"
Shout out to the legends NSYNC!
Time to dance 🎉🎉🎉
I'm going to be playing this all day! Such a fun track. Please release more music together. Your fans have missed you! 'Nsync forever ❤

No lie...I was at work and noticed it was after midnight. Checked YouTube for the song...I freaked out...scared my coworker.....then had this song pretty much on repeat while I filled our shelves and dancing down the aisles. 😂 Thank you Nsync!!!! I NEEDED this pick me up. ❤
Already learning the song! Awesome!
Love the new song!! Yall really do it better together. We love you NSYNC
Thank you so much for this 🥹💗
"¡Gracias Justin Timberlake por decidir re-formar a *NSYNC, una de las boy bands más exitosas! Esta canción para la próxima película de Trolls suena PERFECTA y merece ser un éxito 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥"

This is so good. What a fucking bop! Makes me want to go rollerblading & step out into the sunshine! LFG BOYS! We’re back baby!!!!
There's no other group that go sound that well and create a sweet vibe together. Love you guys❤🎉🎉🎉 thanks for this song😊
👧💞👍👍👍
"I remember I used to listen *NSYNC! The fact that they returned after so many years just to make a banger song for one of my favorite dreamworks franchises is incredible! At first it was only justin timberlake who was attached to trolls, but now the whole band is connected to trolls! 🥹👏"
Thank you NSYNC ❤❤❤❤
Justin if you read this ...create an album called boy band doing covers of obscure boy band song and this song plus like 3 new songs make it easy on you guys lol...much success good luck!!!
Thank you Justin ❤ this is magic ✨🪄 really love it
Thanks Fellas!!  Looking forward to the movie🤗❤️☮️

"Que emoción, soy su fan desde niña, los escucho hasta ahora aunque habían otros cantantes de mi época, me alegra mucho que hayan sacado una nueva canción ☺️"
"Maroon 5 called and wants to know why you stole their sound. Absolute  garbage. After 20 years, you'd think they come up with something better."
NSYNC or JSTNTL
Love it 💚🇧🇷 N'sync forever
♥️🎶🕊🆓️⏲️🆓️🕊🎶♥️

My husband just called me to tell me Nsync was on the radio! I came straight over here ... told the kids they better not miss the bus... I am in a better place this Friday morning ❤❤❤❤
Crying tears of joy. To hear all 5 of you together after all these years is like never skipping a beat! The perfect nostalgia and yet fresh feeling is fantastic. THANK YOU!

My teenage self is very happy right now to hear this song. Thank you and hope you finally bring us a whole new album in the near future
"Ain’t nobody better, you do it better! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Fan since ‘97.. literally grew up idolizing these guys.  Truly warms my heart hearing them together again after all these years.

terrible!
I loved it more than I thought I would! Haha ❤❤❤
"Wow, you can really feel Justin in this song. It's his beat, but they sound great together. Wow, brings me back to a happy time. I hope they do some more songs. I hope they do an album that would be great
🎉😊❤❤❤❤"

"Still fancy the pants off Joey all these years later! 

Welcome back N*Sync. Love the Doja Cat 'Say So' beat too :)"
!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Justin Timberlake❤️🔥
Fiquei com o coração partido quando eles se separaram. Não  acredito que mais de 20 anos depois estou ouvindo uma nova música ❤.  Obrigada por tudo
That's different from the music they used to do I hope they make more music
I really hope this inspires you guys to write more or at least a tour? ❤
Whaaaat
"I'm in N'Sync fan, but why does this sound just like ""Say So"" by Doja Cat?  We waited 20 years for this?  JT must be saving the good songs for his next solo project."
I will forever be nsync fan !!!  🩷🩷🩷🩷 Thank you guys
Fantastic song. After 25 years. Still got it in you 💃🏽❤
I'm over the moon knowing my fav boyband released such an amazing new song after so many years. 'NSync will 4ever be in my heart and this song will be on repeat this weekend in my car. 🎶🎶🎶🎶🤗🤗🤗🤗 #NSyncer4life
"Do do do do do do do
I woke up to you ooo ooo
Wake up wake up breaking news
NSYNC is simultaneous too
Crossing over bridges through
Brothers forts and battles knew
I remember remember them
They look happy happy men
I'm so excited I died again
It must have been somethin somethin they said
It must have been a kiss on Justin's forehead
Tonight I just died yep I'm dead
In your arms tonight the color is red
Doomed I'm doomed doomed I'm dead
I love this news my heart has read"
YESSSS 💓💓💓💓💓💓
Y’a Hoooo flying 🙏🏽🌹🌱🙏🏽🆙🙏🏽🌹🆙🪨🆙🌱🆙🪨🆙🌹🆙🆙

A hit
"Ya había perdido la esperanza con la reunión, pero volvieron 😊"
"Justin Timberlake: Well I did one song for Trolls on my own, and then I had Sza for Trolls 2. Wonder who will I ask now for Trolls 3.


Nsync: Hey Justin can we join in.

Justin Timberlake: Sure lets have an NSync reunion."
It must have a good choreography like in the old times.
The boys from the 90s are back. ❤❤❤❤❤
Waited 20+ years for this 🥹💕
What about CJ voice ? Looks like J Timberlake sings the whole song .
What about CJ voice ? Looks like J Timberlake sings the whole song .
"The best boy and ever existed , the one boys like too !!"
YESSSSS GENTLEMEN YES!!! 😁 MUAH! #SUGAR* 5* 💜 @#ILYUTEOT
Achei estranho. Parece uma música descartada dos últimos álbuns do JT. Não tem cara do pop do N'SYNC.
"NSYNC 💖, Brazil fans will never forget you 💞"
"thank you so much for this 💜 was smiling all the way through, hearing all of you sing together after more than two decades is so so special 🥺 hope this is not the last we hear of you!!"
OH GOD!!! I'M SCREAMING OUT LOUD & CRYING!!! 😭😭😭 NEVER THOUGHT THIS WILL BE HAPPEN 😭😭😭 THANK YOU *NSYNC!!!
Oh c'mon this is not NSYNC this is JC and JT collaboration lol
Encore de la merde sa fait un non 10ans qui a pas sortie un bon son arrête la musique roh
Wow Nsync is back
You guys are literally taking us to a Better Place 😭♥️
Yay ❤ Nsync is back ❤been a fan since 1998 ❤
I've been an *Nsync fan since I was 13 years old... and now I'm 37. I feel like a teenage girl all over again.☺️ This song means soo much.

Wai for the new album guys 
Been so excited to hear this!
Da ist der Tag wieder gerettet ein super Klasse Song 👍🎶🎙️❤ super gemacht 👍 ich freue mich 😊🥰❤️
"You pick up where you left off, with good music.  👍"
"If not a new album, at least re-record the old ones like Taylor Swift did 😉"
"I would like heard more acapella style because nsync is unique on that sense, the song is good but is a little generic without that touch of boys voices."
I love these Guys! ❤ Keep it up Man! Xx
Welcome back jc 👏👏👌👌
راكم كبار روحو توبو لله فات وقتكم
"NSYNC you guys still sync together..❤

"Echoes of Our Hearts from a Better Place: Fan Version to NSYNC

Lyrics:

It’s a kindred pulse,
It’s the beat we share,
You came back to life,
Now we're gasping for air.

Your silence was a void,
But your rhythms fill the space,
We’ve been longing for the noise,
Of our hearts' embrace.

You’ve heard our cries,
Felt the echoes in the night,
The world’s not enough,
Without your music, without your light.

We don’t mind if the world spins faster,
If it brings us closer to your laughter,
We don’t mind if the night grows longer, longer, longer,
As long as we’re dancing in that better place.

We’re gonna shout till the stars collide,
Yeah, let our voices show the way (ah hey),
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic,
Our melodies intertwine today.

We’ll take you to that louder place (yoohoo),
And together we’ll defy the gray,
We’re soaring into a cherished space,
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic, yeah.

Yeah,
Oooh,
Yeah, yeah,

We crave the rhythm, the show,
The bonds that never let go,
We’ll dance through time,
With your rhyme, let’s glow.

Let’s make it echo forever,
Tell everyone we’re here to stay,
When we’re together,
The world’s a stage, come what may.

We don’t mind if the world spins faster,
If it brings us closer to your laughter,
We don’t mind if the night grows longer, longer, longer,
As long as we’re dancing in that better place.

We’re gonna shout till the stars collide,
Yeah, let our voices show the way (show the way),
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic,
Our melodies intertwine today.

We’ll take you to that louder place (yoohoo),
And together we’ll defy the gray,
We’re soaring into a cherished space,
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic, yeah.

Feel the harmony, feel the core (ain’t no party better, we do it better),
This union’s pure,
Say you want more, yeah, yeah (ain’t no party better, we do it better),
Taking us all to that better place.

We’re gonna shout till the stars collide,
Yeah, let our voices show the way (show the way),
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic,
Our melodies intertwine today.

We’ll take you to that louder place (yoohoo),
And together we’ll defy the gray,
We’re soaring into a cherished space,
We’re ecstatic to see you ecstatic, yeah."
Hehehe SSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Love it.... only been 20 years of waiting
Why am I holding back tears. DIOS TE BENDIGA
херасе камбек
I can’t stop listening to this song ❤❤❤
NSYNC is back hope they play old song again like Bye Bye and many more 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I’m loving it 🥰
❤Indonesia is present
So glad you're back with your band JT. The song is a BOP 🙌🏼
"As always, this rythm is the best...
Thank you 🤩🤩🤩"
NSYNC
"Justin!! You did such a good job with the production 😍
The song has a very close ""Can't stop the feeling"" feel to it. Pure pop, fun and very catchy 👏🏻👏🏻"
"NSYNC highly influenced Kpop, that's a fact"
On repeat until further notice! Well worth the wait gentlemen! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
"Now we just need the dance. And then, as always I’ll learn every move for the new dance. Lol. I used to do it every homecoming and prom. I won best dancer back in high school.  Ty NSYNC I was listening to them before they even came out  in the US my cousins friends with Chris."
We love you guys!
Sonho realizado é ver vcs juntos novamente meninos.❤😍👏♥️🇧🇷
What a year!
🎉🎉🎉
I love it🥰
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
JC needs to get rid of his Russell Brand look
As soon as J.C. started it pierced through just like back in the day. Still imo the best part of NSYNC is him.
Omg JC sounds the same… is this 2001??
I never thought I’d see the day! Let’s hope for a tour🤞🏾
AAHH!

"@00:29 for 9 seconds we have the most played and re-played part of this track. I teared up when I heard his voice! The way he intonates to soulify the word 'music' That section, bizzarely, has a lot of 'celebrity' album about it (the fairground feel, reminded me of 'two of us', but actually better). It was crisp AF. Or it's just at least - production and melody wise - quite how much we could imagine NSYNC in 2023. Listening to it, was like 1998 - 2001 again, evoking feelings of being in the back of the car with the discman, hearing each album for the first time. In 1998, i bought the debut album at Manchester airport on the way to Portugal for summer holidays (alienating US and other fans here), and this album didn't leave my ears for the whole two weeks (and of course thereafter until 'no strongs attached'). I can smell the zeitgeist of that holiday right now. It's palpable. The smell of the inside of a crappy hire car on a sweltering day, on the way to 'slide and splash' whilst the intro of 'you got it' kicks in for the very first time.

For these 9 seconds today, I had that opportunity back again. I didn't have the luxury of a tough two hour round bus trip to town to buy the single for £4.99 from Virgin megastore or hmv (further alienating aforementioned fans). I instead had the lucklustre job of opening the laptop and clicking a link. But just as the morning coffee kicked in, @00:29 occured and The hairs stood up, the body got that inexplicable warm shiver shot through its entirety,  and my eyes threatened to fill up (WHOS CHOPPIN' EFFIN ONIONS?!?). 

Oh....the power of Joshua Charles' voice and the power of nostalgia.

Now, We get to discover an NSYNC track again for the first time in 23 years or so. Let's face it. This was Justin's track. Which is fine! And Thank F he asked them to join in. I reckon we got some real NSYNC stuff on the way. They can't do 'this' and it not happen. I bet that if they get on with each other on the reunion tour, we will have new music, in the bag!"
Grazie 👍👋

Announce the tour boys 🎉
NSYNC has been my favorite band since I was 6yrs old. This is the best day! 🎉😭🙌 welcome back guys!! 🥂🫶
I missed them so much 😭
❤❤❤ 21 years ago I wait the crew it s be coming back welcome guys!!! best song love it!!!
The song is beautiful.
You guys killed it!  Instant classic!
"Finally, we got you back together ❤️"
Super love it! ❤
I’m going to have this on replay for days! Happy to have new music  🤩
"It's cute this but sounds like such a solo JT reject. It's very ""can't fight this feeling""
Also, as a causal fan who can't truly recognize each of their voice, I barely heard Lance? He has a gorgeous voice, I wish they utilised him more.
Edit: I learned after that this is for the trolls soundtrack so it makes sense, it's clearly a JT song that they tacked the boys on."
"Love it!!  Instant download!  You’ve still got it!  Thank you, guys!"
*oh em gee!! What a lovely surprise! <3*
thank you so much from Malaysia
Está buena la rola!
OMG!!! That 5 part harmony! I’ve missed it so much. Love the song!
Banger!! ❤
"Partied with the Tribe for the debut and we gave this one high praises 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

W RETURN"
Ohhhh ❤❤ I Love it😮😮 #nsyncfan #betterplace
Miau 😺
This makes me nostalgic for my 20s.
JC's voice! Obsessed with this song!
2 voices and 3 whistles 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂. Same Bs
Mil gracias estoy ansioso por el nuevo cd🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
THIS GOING VIRAL AF
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeee I’m so excited to see you excited
I think a song with Eminem will be dope !!!!!
I love you NSYNC❤❤❤❤❤
This song gives me all the feels.  I think it has the perfect melody and we can not wait what more there is to come!
I think they really comeback but this just one of many tracks in Trolls. Poor their fans.
💯🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️👍
Thank you so much for this song. Seeing you back together has given me so much life the past few weeks. I hope there is more where this came from!! 👀
"Thank you *NSYNC for doing this the song is amazing I am so sorry you guys can't release a music video or perform the song live because of the #Sagstrike but hopefully, it will end soon and you guys can still have a chance"
"""when we're together, you know that we do it better"" -Nsync"
This song is amazing!!! *NSYNC is amazing .. !!❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NSYNC THE LEGENDS ARE BACK FINALLY!
My god I feel like I’m 14 again lol this song is sooooo good.
Love this song. I miss NSYNC! Song's catchy and I memorize the whole song already due to your short clips. Anyways PLEASE MAKE AN ALBUM! 😘
As soon as JC started singing I immediately started crying!! The way they still harmonize after all these years makes my heart so happy!!
1 año de gira nada más pedimos
"I love NSYNC but I'm not digging it. It definitely sounds like a song made for a Trolls movie which it is but I want some ""classic"" NSYNC pop songs and not trying to get on with the times."
Woah! as always Justin taking all the song and the other imperceptible
"It's some kind of love, it's some kind of fire
I'm already up but you lift me higher
You know I'm not wrong, you know I'm not lyin'
We do it better, yeah, we do it better, yeah

I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves are gettin' stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster

Just let me take you to a better place (Oh)
I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place, yoo-hoo-ooh
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah

Yeah, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
You like the bed style loud, I wanna lose control
I wanna dance all night, you like it nice and slow
Don't want it any other way, tell all your friends you're gonna stay
When were together, you know that we do it better

I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves are gettin' stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster

Just let me take you to a better place (Oh)
I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way (Show the way)
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place, yo-hoo-ooh
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah

I like to see you lose control (Ain't nobody better, we can do it better)
I know a place, say that you'll go with me (Ain't nobody better, we can do it better)

Just let me take you to a better place
I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way (Show your way)
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place, yo-hoo-ooh
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah"
This is not the sound of Nsync. This is Just Timberlake. Sorry... Another song like all the others.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for comeback Nsync 😭
Thank you for being excited to see us excited *NSYNC!  💃🏻  🕺 🪩
Awww I Love It❤️
JT ❤❤❤
"i love ""Better Place""! ❤ now more *NSYNC please, Justin! more music, and contents from You guys, pleaseeeee. 🥹🙏 we miss You!

P.S., will there be an official music video for ""Better Place""? with *NSYNC in it?"

🥹🥹🥹
I remember 20+ years ago everyone I knew kept telling me they would never get back together. I refused to believe it. I love NSYNC so much. I just couldn’t accept at the time they were going their separate ways. I just didn’t want to believe it. I went to their concerts. Their music is all I listened too. They were such role models to me. I was heart broken when they broke up. I can’t believe 20+ years later I’m listening to a new NSYNC song. It’s been so long. So much has happened in the world. This means so much to me. ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you!!!!!! I love you guys!! *NSYNC FOREVER!!!
You guys didn’t disappoint 🥲🫶🏻 #nsyncforever
"The ""Love Letter"" we've been yearning for 💕 Thank you! WICKED EXCITED"
This is popinn like Janet's Titty :P
"I was more excited for this song than I was for Jungkook’s new song tonight, both are good songs 💜"
Put world tour on the list!!!❤
Tremendo sonido que se mandaron. 🔝🔝🔝

Congrats!🎉 so excited about the this reunion! Look forward to more!🎉
"This has been such a long time coming, over 20 year’s and I’m literally crying tears of joy! My boy’s well men now are back! The 16 year old me is so happy! I just came across a vhs I recorded when I was a sophomore in high school of their first televised concert on the Disney Channel and oh how I wish I had a VCR to watch it again!"
Not me ugly crying over here while listening to the first new *NSYNC song in over 20 years!!
Love it

If this isn’t proof that ya’ll need to make another album I don’t know what  is. This is perfection! Please make more music together. I think we all need more *Nsync. I don’t think it ends with this song. I know it’s not actually effortless and it just looks that way but seriously this masterpiece does not sound like it was hard to create either. I hope you all are able to perform/record together during this tour but please please please get back together after it. We all need more *Nsync magic! 💜🧡💚💙❤️🙏🏻🫶🏻😻🥰

"Im praying for better days in the education system. We are still trying pick up the pieces after the pandemic. Some people want a ""new"" normal others want the old. As a college student learning how to teach and everything i say lets just what we've always strived for: ""Whats best for the children."""

"This song has played at my work a few times I've been wanting to find it, and its a beautiful and uplifting song, it speaks a truth... to the good, bad and ugly things we all work through in hopes of something better, to those who've lost sigh of their light and strength, this song I feel is a reminder to that and so much more"

Song deserves billion views!
"Ant and Justin...thank you. I teared up instantly. I am a mom, a student and a dv survivor, brain surgery survivor.  I dedicated my life to fighting for clean water. Born and raised on Lake Erie right outside Buffalo, NY. I'm working towards Law school for Environmental Law.  Domestic Voilence at the hands of my sons father caused permanent neurological damage.  I found out after spending 2020 finding my diagnosis journey while he continued to break the order. A total of 33x..it continues. It took until Dec 2021 to get my chiari diagnosis, after an unnecessary hysterectomy, fibromyalgia diagnosis, ptsd/cptsd diagnosis. The physical violence shook my brain that much. The surgery made things worse. I wanted to be a dancer too, take classes. Dancing has always been healing for me. I feel God when I dance. I can't dance like I wanted to before. I had dreams. Have dreams. Everyday is a reminder of what this man stole from me. I'm on excruciating pain from the second I wake up until I fall asleep. It's not just pain. If I do too much,  I'll slur my words for a week, or worse. I haven't been able to do Christmas, school shopping, birthday presents or even the tooth fairy because the jobs I've done were too strenuous. I even got an internship surveying water for my county..a dream job. I ended up in the hospital, and spent 4 days on the couch after a creek revaluation. I lost my job.. 

I live with God in my heart every single day. I know there's a plan for us. I was on town committees, working to introduce legislation. I was even nominated by my Professors for the National Society of Leadership and success prior to this. My world has crumbled...and there were times I wanted to give up...but I know we will rebuild..and my family and I will heal. He is in custody for breaking the order..still. I am packing and leaving the state with the help of advocates and crisis services because I lost my county job. I've never moved out state before. I have a 40lb lifting forever and I'm packing my house by myself. There are days I cry...days I scream..and days I just exist. Everyday I pray. 

Thank you for making me feel seen and hopeful. 🙏"
So Scar leave nin playland and prod this footage of bubafecey action sequence
"Toni Lynne D, you think these are ""Better Days""?  Idiot!  Justin Timberlake sounds awesome as usual but Ant Clemons needs to learn to sing without needing his voice auto-tuned to death."
"better days huh, when does that start"

I thought I heard Chris Brown
"This song has become a staple in life since I played it on repeat during a very rough time. I was alone for what felt like weeks,  battling alcoholism and quarantine as well as intense loneliness... I was questioning life... I held on long enough to seek help. FJK Masego Tadow helped me, too. Life saved. Thank you."
My heart goes out to Ukraine 🇺🇦 😢
"I heard this on an episode of 9-1-1 and fell in love with it. Ant is a talented young man, love his voice!"

RIP Ahmaud Arbery. Always and forever in our hearts🕊🕊🕊🕊
Notice how Justin doesn't have all those Autotune effects on it.
"This song reminds me of my favourite kenyan band called 'Sauti sol's song, 'brighter days' but in its own way of course <3 love this"
"How is this the 1st time I’ve ever heard this song? It’s been out for 11 months…

My skin is like the night sky. My skin hides in the dark. Shinning like the stars."
"Swizz beats
I don't want to stand for the black people. Because they ain't everybody. Not Everybody is black or brown Or light brown. Why can't we stand for everybody. Not just for the skin but for everything. Because not every body is black or brown skinned or light brown."

You want Justin Timberlake to preach about the black community. Your wish came true. Your wish is coming true."
"Swizz beats

I wonder if people realize they are downloading this version on Itunes when the live version from the Inauguration is also on Itunes. I love them both but love the live version even more! Great song!
Yes!
Here after the inauguration and when I saw this on the TV I almost cried just bc of how happy this song made me feel
"This song puts me in a very positive space that holds hope, and encouragement...Thank you so much. Wish i  knew about it sooner when it was really really needed...but never too late for good news."
"Wow JT really takes over every collab he's in
Ant Clemons did an amaxibg job though"
My boss is trying to fire me after I was jobless and depressed 😔
Beautifully done.💯❤️😁✌🏾
Had not heard of Ant Clemons. I love his voice and hopeful lyrics! I’ve been singing it since the inauguration. Thank you!

"Better Days are coming 💯
Kicked out, stepped on, let down, waited for too long for something, feel weak, hurting. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Feeling lost in the light. Better is ahead 🙏"
"Blasting  ""Better Days"" with my Bose headphones on, pullin up to my new crib in LA...      

Better Believe!"
Another song added to my playlist!! Better days are coming!!! ❤
"Iits a new time and we are looking to better days for our America collectively and not so divided. Let's unite closer thru our love for music regardless of ethnicity, race or gender preference. We the people have our own individual life sound tracks...let's allow ourselves to be more inclusive, friendlier and accepting of others inspite of our personal and political differences. We are in the end all the same Americans that are strongest when United...especially against other ideologies and lesser forms of governments than OURS, THE GREATEST ABOVE ALL ON THIS PLANET. ""STOP THE DIVIDING, ACT FOR UNITING AND LET MUSIC KEEP REFLECTING OUR JOY AND LOVE FOR LIFE AS WE ARE LEADERS BY EXAMPLE. PLAY IT LOUD MY FELLOW SOULS. SEMPER FIDELIS"
Better believe that!!
"Never heard of Ant before until tonight, took my breath away, great job!!!While JT is awesome, Ant needs to get the credit that he deserves...well done young man!!"
What an amazing song that the two of you wrote Justin! It is so befitting for the occasion!! Thank you Kanye West for your discovery of yet another amazing talent!! You truly are a musical genius!
Made me think of Sam Cooke's Change Is Gonna Come
Two beautiful voices ! And so much talent. I ❤️ this song.
"Gorgeous song, they crushed it at the inauguration performance."
Simply amazing. You woke a nation and made us believe. Thank you.
Love this song!!!❤❤❤❤

"Going through a divorce .. thank you!🙏🏽🙏🏽🇺🇸 🙌🏽🙌🏽

I wish they would stop with the Auto Tune crap. Either you can sing or you can't. All this voice compression and over production makes everybody sound like a damn robot.
Inauguration 2021❤
Man I finally found it. Better days. This is beautiful 😻
This is my new personal anthem and I'll be sharing this widely.  Thank you!

This song at the inauguration was lit and made me cry
This song is AWESOME....Just press on...better days days are coming💯❤🌈
The Inauguration brought me here to this awesome song
"60y strong,old,tired discarded Mom...now Nonna since 9/5/20 Guradian Angel w/hold onto my grandson he will live w/a piece of my💖 heart as we are denied each other💔
Covid displaced,I've survived and endured more than my share 60yrs,now in a place I've never known 8mths.....💔Smiling thru my tears n fears-I watched history made from my hotel room...just heard this song-many of us just hangin'on✌🙏💜
Selfless perfectly imperfect me....I woke up today-All else a bonus...priveleged only to have been born in U.S.A the greatest country on earth🎗......Kindness is free!

We are each responsible for our own choices we make...I am a lifetime overcomer/survivor of the 'Evil'choices of others...

Choose Evil....Karma chooses you👹

60y strong=God knows"
The Inauguration brought me here💯💣💥
I usually hate mainstream music but this is a great song

Wow Ant has an amazing voice. Blown away. Justin has always been great.
I just heard this song for the first time and I am absolutely bawling my eyes out! Thank you for one of the most meaningful and inspiring songs. You have no idea how much this means to me and to us all. Just... thank you!
The performance was amazing. Caught me off guard. It actually made me smile during some really tough times right now. Thank you for the joy that I felt as I listen to the words of the song and the performers who did an incredible job
"To all Americans that’s suffering from Covid, to all Americans that has lost love ones to this deadly disease. Better days are coming. The Most High God said He would not sit in Zion and hear his children cry. He is going to heal the land. But people please wear your mask. Be obedient to the laws of the land. And our BETTER DAYS WILL COME!  I love all of you that’s reading this,  mean it. If you doesn’t return the love, I love you still!"
I cried 😢  love this
"What a great song There come better days for our country USA, God Bless America....very nice for the opening of  Joe R. Biden on January 20, of 2021"

"There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feelin' lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It gets worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh, better days)
Better days, better days (Better and better and better, oh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Better days, better days)

I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for somethin' to lean on (Lean on)
You feel weak, just be strong (Ooh)
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on


You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel (At the end of the tunnel)
Keep your eyes on the road ahead (On the road ahead)
And if you're feelin' lost in the night (Lost in the night)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better (Aah)
Better's ahead, (Better) better's ahead (Aah)
It gets worse 'fore it gets better (Ah-ah-ah)
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh, I know, I know)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days) (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days)

I know you feel left out and stepped on
Keep goin', keep goin'
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

(It gets better)
Better days, better days are comin' (Better days)
Better days, better days (On their way) are comin' ('Cause I know)
Better days, better days (Better days) are comin' (Yeah)
Better days, (Oh) better days are comin' (I know)
Better days are comin'"
This should have way more views than it does this song is 🔥
Listening from Saudi Arabia serving my country!  This song gives me HOPE!

Who's here from Ten's live?
Love this song is better days
Better days will come soon in this difficult time. 🙏🏽
Wow thank you from Ukraine )
This song sucks. Straight up garbage. JT needs to slam dunk this in the can. Hes an over rated loser anyhow. Better Days.... Is Biden gonna have a sniff of you jussy?
Thank you.
This is the first 6/8 song I think I ever heard JT on... how's this even possible lol
"Jt wrote a good song, give him respect"
"It seems Justin has lost his magic rhythm,,, This song lacks a hook and could be produced by any common singer. He needs to collaborate again with Timberland and get some good music out to the public."
u sad man Justin
This man right here!!!!! I’ve seen JT live 3 times! The mans a legend!!!!! Love you JT 💙
So excited to see this performed live at the inauguration!!
"Love this song, can not wait to see new movie Palmer. JT still as awesome as ever."

This spoke to my soul. I felt the healing as the song played.
Any Clemons is sooo good!!
💓💓💓
"How did I miss this song

Its beautiful!!!"
"Ant clemon ""better days are coming""
His Hoodie ""Difficult road ahead""."
Justin needs to acknowledge LeAndria... They know that's a mix of that woman's song.
https://youtu.be/YRo5A_WgfLY
How has this not blown up?
300.000k in One month? What is going on? Everysong JT makes deserves more
"You all know there are two singing on this song, right? Everyone is going crazy for JT but Ant outshines him on the song and in the video."

Who else in January 2021 listening this masterpiece?
This is my boyfriend
"Beautiful song.💙
 After almost a year of unconstitutional lockdowns and no basic human rights, all the lies... All the deaths because of the lockdowns. It's hard to imagine better days. I don't even recognize the reality we live in anymore. Evil agenda's from all directions. Music, reading and my art are keeping me sane. Maybe my better day's are coming when I leave this place. I will be free again."
Most goosebumps effects inspired song beautiful 🔥🔥🔥🌟🎆🎆
Danke Justin :))
Voice is goods 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Happy new year for you
When I feeling down I listen to this song
Amei
"Justin Timberlake Stay Blessed As Always. May God Bless, Guide You And Protect You Very Much."
I love you JT
"Better days are here and more are coming. I am reveling in the days that are coming!!! I love you world, all that is. Thank you for all you contribute, we all have tremendous value. Love, light, peace, joy, harmony, prosperity, unlimitedness. We are blessed beyond measure!!!"

This song is amazing!! Thank you Justin and Stacey Abrams for all the work you do to make the world a better place!! #fairfight
Make me smile and emotional 😍 music is really powerfull
"Follo4folloback 👏
Sigueme y te sigo segurito 👍"
what happened to the dance justin Timberlake please bro
"Justin Timberlake gets better every year. Not many people can boast that like he does.
Also his acting career is damn hilarious."
I wish I could hold on to this optimism.
"I'm calling dibs on Te. ⛄. It's more than 50 50 Biebs. It's me...Do you get that? I want to introduce myself. I'm Chief Smoke-a-Moe-Smoke...My next challenge is to live by the Swole in NCM...I can wait forever, but . I can't let the next Angel go away. ☃. Remember that Bt? 🗻⛰🗻⛰🚜"
"Never heard of Ant Clemons. Great voice. JT needs to be doing more solo songs similar to this and speak to his generation as an artist more, especially in these times and being at the forefront. Hope he finds his Marvin Gaye gear so to speak. Reminds me when he did the All-Star collaboration of What's Going On 2 decades ago and his joint Losing My Way. This is fresh & super necessary."
"This needs more views ... This song is so beautiful and positive . Thank you for this, good way to sum up our departure from 2020"
Greetings from Peru🌎 you are a beautiful .
I don’t like you
A current day hymnal!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Amazing talent. This song is on repeat.
Ant and Justin perfect song for 2021

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feeling lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It get's worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (ooh-ooh, better days)
Better days, better days (better and better and better, oh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (better days, better days)

I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for somethin' to lean on (lean on)
You feel weak, just be strong (ooh)
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on

You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel (at the end of the tunnel)
Keep your eyes on the road ahead (on the road ahead)
And if you're feelin' lost in the night (lost in the night)
It's okay to cry (it's okay to cry)
Just as long as you hold your head

Better's ahead (better), better's ahead (ah)

Better days are comin' (ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days, better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
And better days are comin' (ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days)

I know you feel left out and stepped on
Keep goin', keep goin'
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

Better days, better days are comin' (better days)
Better days, better days (on their way) are comin' ('cause I know)
Better days, better days (better days) are comin' (yeah)
Better days (comin'), better days (I know)
Better days are comin'"

I appreciate both artists equally for this bc it's for Ant's album but Justin made a feature cuz it wouldn't be a complete song if one person did it so two people's vocals really balanced the song
This is the first JT's song I've heard and instantly I became his fan !! 😍
I want believe in it🙏🏻❤️
Thank's for all Justin <3
Love lit💘

"Sorry but the song is really boring. Cool lyrics, but the melody is way too repetitive and flat 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Halelooooya 🙌
Great song with great sentiments. Excellent voices and tones!
"President Trump gave us better days, a better America, and he didn’t try to cheat to become Our American President. He flat out beat the wicked witch of the Clintons. If you think that joe n the bozo Harris is going to do better you’re an idiot. If they get in, America will fall to China the perpetrator of the CCP virus that no one will hold them accountable for ... what a sad commentary!"
Very good song I really liked JT's part 👌🏾
Stacey A is a corrupt DemocRAT!  Case closed!
I need this!

"Was happy like a kid when i'd seen the notif,scarce to see such beautiful songs in time like this,spirit all high like glorified!"
❤
"Not if Democrats take over. (Which is what Justin wants) I've been Justin's biggest fan since day 1. Since NSYNC released their first song here. But him and other Hollywood puppets have been pushing their political views on the public. Stop listening! They ate told what to do. They are not like us. Millionaires with no worries, no clue . I will always be a fan of your music Justin, but that's it. I have a feeling the end is coming, and even with your money & supplies, even you, aren't safe."
"Got my job interview tomorrow.
   Better days are coming ~ I believe it.



Edit: Got the job 🤗"
Poor JT another flop in his career !!! 🤗😬😬
"Hey, y'all did the damn thing, big man. I appreciate you helping put me on to Ant Clemons with this one. I'm looking forward to what you have coming up, because 2020 has been a W year for you, musically. Don't be shy to drop a new *NSYNC single before the end of this year, either, bucko."
Great song and video...
Damn JT sounds incredible! 🙌🙌🙌 Beautiful song!
"I've been listening to this song on repeat on Spotify, and lemme just say how happy I am that there's finally a music video for this song. 🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻🥰😍😭🙌🏻 This song gives me hope, strength, and the courage to keep pressin' on, even during difficult times."

"К вопросу о том, когда в голове полно разных мыслей
Прежде всего нужно понять и принять свой ум - как вашего маленького ребёнка.
Когда вы это сделаете, вы поймёте, что его нужно буквально точно так же воспитывать как вы воспитываете своего ребёнка - на пример:
Ваш ребёнок говорит всякие гадости - что вы будете делать? Как будете влиять на это поведение? Вот! Точно так же и с мыслями.
Вы можете сказать в глубину себя:
Так!!!Чтоб Я больше не слышала этих мыслей и им подобные!!!Можно даже в мыслях крикнуть,приструнить! Самообразование, самовоспитание - своего рода.
Дальше есть такая поговорка и понимание, которое мне открыла Галина Гунчак - свято место, пусто не бывает.
Ваше мышление - это святая святых! И если в голове водятся всякие гадости или просто ненужные мысли - это значит что вы достаточно свободно себя чувствуете и слишком много вольностей даёте своему уму - чего это он у вас бездельничает и всякие гадости или просто ненужности думает?Что не чем занять свой ум???Вот и займите его! Созидайте. Не нравятся мысли - вступайте в процесс мышления и создавайте собственные на благо всего мира.
И кстати,Друзья, благая весть!

"Lyrics🔊
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feeling lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It get's worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh, better days)
Better days, better days (Better and better and better, oh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Better days, better days)

I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for something to lean on (Lean on)
You feel weak, just be strong (Ooh)
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on

You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel (At the end of the tunnel)
Keep your eyes on the road ahead (On the road ahead)
And if you're feelin' lost in the night (Lost in the night)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better (Aah)
Better's ahead, (Better) better's ahead (Aah)
It get's worse 'fore it gets better (Ah-ah-ah)
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh, I know, I know)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days) (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days)

I know you feel left out and stepped on
Keep goin', keep goin'
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

(Because there's better)
Better days, better days are comin' (Better days)
Better days, better days (On their way) are comin' ('Cause I know)
Better days, better days (Better days) are comin' (Yeah)
Better days, (Oh) better days are comin' (I know)
Better days are comin'"

What  a  lovely 😍   song
It's like being in a relationship with a Japanese Ninja Master. Both genders are equally lethal emotionally in ways that would make even a Samurai blush. Given the choice between the two I'll always pick a Ninja😊
My all time favorite Justin Timberlake song. I listen to this song more than his other songs.
They just completed another album 😩🥴
Tko!
Who’s here after TikTok? 😭 My poor baby 💔
2023 and still my favorite everrrr
HE'S A LEGEND
Respect to the guinea pigs for providing background vocals for 7 minutes straight without a single break from the rhythm. Impressive 👏

Who’s hear in 2020? This song slaps
"At least 6 years later and I'm still discovering small touches and pieces that contribute to the sound of Timbaland's production on this, and many other songs he and Justin released on these albums. Amazing how crossing old school sounds and techniques with very modern, and at times futuristic sounds makes this timeless."
2020 still rocking this
This song reminds me of my 1st boyfriend it was toxic 4 sure especially the video glad I grew up wow TKO

Kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo
Ah, she kill me with the coo, coochie-coochie-coo

[Justin Timberlake:]
Baby, everyday you're training to get the gold
That's why your body's crazy
But you can't run from yourself, that's where it's difficult

Girl I can see in your eyes that there's
Something inside that made you evil
Where did you go?
'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore
TKO

I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO

Now, I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

Baby, now I don't really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody's heart is swollen
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside
That made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know, no, not anymore
TKO

I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO, T-T-TKO
Out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count, yeah, girl, you knock me out

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie

"To start with i thought he was saying ""Tea kettle"" then I realized it  said TKO then for the longest I never knew what that meant until just now when I saw a commerical that said ""TKO : Total Knockout"" and that was when I realized"
Someone needs to make an OK K.O. AMV of this.

Can't believe that this year will be 4 fucking years since the song came out. 4! How was 2013 four years ago?
This song doesn't get the recognition it deserves at all
This is my hip hop song go dance at TDC the dance center is rocky River Ohio it's amazing with Ms. Heidi Glenis

Song
I'm in a spng
My name is TK I love this song
"I still salute this, till this day."
That intro...GODDAMN! WOO!
"This is the first song I liked by Justin from his last two albums. This and Not Such A Bad Thing were the only good singles, as far as I'm concerned. And it's funny that TKO sounds more in wheelhouse, but live he messes this song up."
"God this production is amazing, Timbaland really knows how to mix."
happy mother's day
randomly decided to hear this song today! Timbaland did an excellent job w producing !!
Didn't Miranda sings dance to this in a video? I can't find it :(

Any beatboxers out there? Help me out.. I'm trying to find out the name of the movie that Justin does after the bell.. Anyone know the name of it? It's at 4:58
Who else thinks he sounds like Louis Tomlinson?
What does TKO stand for? Timberlake Knock Out?
RKO outta nowhere!!! ;)
Dope
I dont understand it tell me how can you be so low?
TEA COW
What the heck is with teacow it is clearly tko and if you think it is tea cow your freaking stupid get a hearing aid and listen closely TKO learn it live it love it 
As you can also see it is also hard for me to let things go. If you say anything mean you will be blocked from me and will be hearing from my mom. It also doesn't help that my parents are divorced. People also gang up on me for money and I can't say no. 
"I know how I said I can't defend myself cause I don't know how and your probably thinking well how r u defending yourself right now. My mom read ur comments and is helping me with this. She isn't happy with your comments like me stevenissmexy. This may seem ridiculous but its taking bunches of time and courage to complete these comments. Some other things I forgot to add to my list were I do and say things differently and I get made fun of bc of it sometimes. People shoot me weird looks like I am stupid or something. I also got potty trained real late. Words sometimes don't come out of my mouth right either. I went to rainbows united and sung in the choir and was on the news and got to hold the sign. I also played for miracle league baseball. People also call me retarded and that hurts my feelings. 

I am intelligent and I know it. I have strengths and weaknesses

Strengths: social studies, English, making charts and lists, make hilarious movies on the app iMovie, I can spell really big words, reading, good with the iPad, Wii, 3ds, android tablets, LISTENING.

Weaknesses: Math, science, singing, dancing, being social ( except internet wise), making friends sports ( except softball ).

As you can see I am not good at stuff as most kids are because I am unique and autistic."
BTW thank you Maxwell Cullen for saying not to talk bad about autistic people. Connor Lamb you know what it is like.
"Look stevenissmexy FYI I have autism. It is not easy being autistic so think before you say on social media cause you can offend or really hurt someone. BTW you already have.I am reporting your comment. You wouldn't know how hard it is. Here is a list of things that makes it hard. I have had early intervention so I am better.
1 unable to say what I want 
2 hard to make friends
3 I get bullied
4 I have to go to doctors, therapists, and get medicines repeatedly.
5 difficult to do schoolwork ( but I am on honor roll )
6 I get stressed ALL THE TIME 
7 Can't defend myself cause I don't know how ( that might seem ridiculous to u but it is true.

Look how would you like it if you or one of your friends or family members had autism wouldn't you want empathy? So give empathy and think before you say something."

"It doesn't even sound like ""tea cow"""
"Urban Dictionary: Tea Cow is a term that can be used to sing along to Justin Timberlake's song ""TKO"". The YouTuber Colleen Ballinger (physcosoprano) made a point by saying that it doesn't sound like Justin Timberlake says TKO, it sounds like he says TEA COW. You could also use TEA COW when you would like to have a burger and some tea. This can also be referred to as a tea dispenser that looks like a cow.
""What would you like?"" 
""A burger and some tea please!"" 
""You mean TEA COW!?"" 
""That sounds like Justin Timberlake song."" 
""Yes! He says TEA COW!""

TKO- Timberlake Knock-Out
This has gotten more views than on his vevo channel...
Hey all! this audio stream is now on JT vevo channel let's make some views for him :)
This is my shit
"When this video comes out, the 2nd part of the song where the beat changes, just in is going to KILL that dance scene, because I know he's going to dance at that part. Can't wait. Without a doubt, my favorite song right now and one by him period."
This song is EPIC! check out my dance video to this song!
Timbalind with his same voice.
The beat sounds like Chris Brown's Kiss Kiss to me.
lord if that beat doesnt drop at 5:00 ....then i dont know what does.
"MV please, you're filming it too long :("
Guinea pigs!
Loved it the first time I heard it
I like it when he says TKO
LOL =)
Plus a TKO is given when a boxer is knocked down 3 times in a round...life makes sense now.
I love this song(=
Favorite song....thn carabet
Lights out TKO!!!
Lights out TKO!!!
Lights out TKO!!!
Lights out TKO!!!

Could y'all shut up and bring some peace to this song
"Is it just me, or does everything after 4:55 sound really hot and sexy???"
"All I can hear is the guinea pig ""oinking"" in the background"
The only thing i hear during the whole video is a guinea pig in the background.
"Timberlake knock out (TKO)
"
"Lesson for the day-Don't argue with Idiots, they bring you to their level then beat you with experience....."
this beat is sick! love it <3

Anyone else hear a guinea pig?
Best fucking song ever
TKO should be Timberlake Knock Out
"God dang it, guy stole my name and made a song out of it. :( even worse, it's a Justin Timberlake song, that repeats over, and over, and over again. I wish I could say ""that's not my name"" but it is..."
"You keep telling yourself that, mate ;)"
:feelsbatman:
#Re-Fucking-Peat 
"He should not even film a video for this flop. I mean, it sound so 2007-2008.
I hope that Kabaret or Only When I Walk Away to get a great airplay he deserves."
"jt mirrors 115 149 676 views and the fu*** miley song 221147 684 in 3 weeks  what this shiit people :/ -_-

"I was just trying to help! (softly cries to self) If he wants to sound smarter than the other guy, he needs to fix his mistakes! (Crying while yelling now). Just kidding about the crying shit. Dude, lady, whatever the fuck you are.....I was only informing him so he can better his insults for his next eFight!"
I cant wait for the vid
My sentence and word choice are actually correct in this instance. Nice try though! You'll get the next one!
Like if you think gerbils are taking over UR HEAD!
TEKEO TEKO TEKO TEKO
I hate the fact that it takes me half the song to get to the comment that started this argument....My popcorns almost gone...
Love it
pepeka pepeka pepeka
Omfg its stuck in my head!!!!!!
All I hear is mice and gerbils! !
"Justin appears to have incorporated the lyrical stylings of the cavia porcellus, commonly known as the guinea pig.  The squeaks cannot be unheard."
"Wait... does he say ""She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo"" KILLED BY A COOCHIE!?"
"Indeed. Unfortunately, that is a habitual trend growing in the YT community. Users usually bring up grammatical fallacies in an argument if they:
1. Are losing in an argument.
2. Bear hatred towards the individual.
3.Are jealous(top comment...)

Usually(and sadly) the purporter of the grammatical fix doesn't seek to help the other party's grammar, just to use it against them."
"*I'd really hate
*Any smarter. ""Less dumb,"" sounds too terse and convoluted. "
In other words... getting knocked out 3 times
It's retarded that we resort to pointing out grammatical errors. Who tf cares ?????!!!! This isn't the 3rd grade
Nope it sounds like guinea pigs being killed lol
T= Timba + Land + Lake = KO
Mieses Lied xD
Thanks....now that is the only thing I can concentrate on in this song! Hahahaha
"I really hate to be that guy buuuuuttttttt you have so many spelling errors and grammar issues in your rant. It really doesn't make you look any less dumb than the guy you are trying to insult.....I know you probably don't care, just thought you should know! ;)"
I'm not the only one who hears the Guinea Pigs in the background right? 
Knock Out Técnico = TKO
ITS JUST A TKO  DAMN JUSTIN YOU STILL FINEEE <333
"I love this song more than take back the night, he just sounds annoying in it, this one has better beats and he sounds better"
"No , she really wasn't  if You actually read it and think about it . .
Educate yourself Read her 2 comments over ."
TKO!!!
It sounds like a guinea pig the squeaks
I LOLED so hard at this haha!!!!
I am sooooooo excited! :D
"As much as I love this song, I do agree with you! Timbaland's voice is annoying in this song! Still love this song and Justin! c:"
With Justin ahaha! (if you are a girl if not sorry LOL)
But good song
Who plays minecraft comment

It means the chick (Sarcastically) knocked him out by cheating on him. Its a pretty creative concept.
this is the internet. grammar does not exist.
Love this beat

"No, it's actually technical knock out. Search it up."
"Yeah, society nowadays. People spell ""nowadays"" as ""now adayz"""
TKO = Technical Knock Out. It's a boxing term

Love its song!
"Soooo.....whats with the random guinea pig squeaks in the background or is everyone just ignoring that?

"i like the song but that annoying sqeeking make,s the song really annoying

In the picture in this video I noticed that Justin Timberlake looks a lot like Jim Carey. 
"TKO, Take Back the Night, and You Got It On are the best songs on part 2 of the 20/20 Experience! Keep making amazing music JT!"
"I believe this isn't on the radio cause its not a real release, it was to promote the new album. Like a teaser, that's why there is no video. But I could be wrong. JT is too busy with his new movie"
Just went from listening to Paris Hilton's new song. Which the the worst song I've have ever heard. To listening to TKO! Thank you Justin for saving music. I freakn love u!!!
"Just a TKO. It can't stop me.
Just stand up and fight for a new match. this not a last fighting that i did for you. again and again. Remember that,  it just a first TKO"
"Timberlake Knock Out
lol"
Tko sounds like K.O lol

You have a point there
Why isn't this on the radio?!
TKO!! LOL LOVE  SONG
Who knew he could continuously bring sexy back?  
No it's actually technical knock out

GIMME MUSIC VIDEO NAO!!!!!
"President of pop, prince of pop, best everything ending in POP."
damn that last minute and a half is like extra fire. dont get me wrong the whole song is dope but wow bringing that heat at the end for sure. 
"love it

It would be even better if they brought the intro back after the chorus. Love it!
Actually it's technical knock out but who cares. Great song!
Justin Timberlake IS BACK :D!!!
"it stand for technical knockout, not total knockout."
And as always Timbaland
In love with tis song!
LOVE THIS SONG<3

JT/Timberland combo is like bread and butter!
why not?
Is that a guinea pig in the background?
is that supposed to be good thing? ...
Technical Knockout.
"I can't believe my local radio station in the Bay Area plays the whole damn song in full and everything! Normally, radio stations around my area have to cut off certain parts in order for it to be around 3-4 minutes, but it seems like they made an exception with JT! XD Anyways, a pretty cool song with an even better second half! Hahaha!"
"I love this song... But if you listen closely, the squeaking sound in the beat sounds like a guinea pig. Or am I the only one that thinks that?"
"@rapstarese, dont talk to me like that, you dont know me, be respectful. literally no reason to be a jerk."
Loooooove it!!! 3
This is and will most likely forever be my favorite song
"theres a gunea pig in the background of the song
"
"Love it! and Justin, don't change.....ever!! "
I love jt hes a wigger
"not sure when it was realised but hoping it will be ""released"" soon!"
the type of woman who listens to this.
"I hate that ""she kills me with that cooch cooch coochie coo"". It's somewhat offensive and how is that remotely attractive to a woman when her reproductive organs are being referred to that l:"
And this is the only thing I can think of: youtu.be/u1UMb9f7GBA?t=25s
This song needs to get to the top 10 of hot 100
thx. someone said it's total knockout
Now all I hear is guinea pigs :/

This song has got one Phat beat! JT is more than an artist the guys an entertainer......keep kicking it man keep on kicking it!
"Saw the Legends of the Summer Tour in Vancity on July 31st. Damn, he can sing and dance so well live. OMG <3. I will be 90 and jamming out to Justin Timberlake."
I want jay z on this song
"He s back . Perfect. Ideal. When his song is on body starts moving. What a great singer,performer.I'm in lobe with his music hah."
Even being a girl I grew up watching lots of boxing with my dad and still love the sport although I'm leaning more towards loving MMA these days...I knew exactly where he was going with this song lol.
"I'm not worried about the critics. JT shouldn't be either. My fav artists of all time are MJ & Prince; critics bashed their works post ""Thriller"" & ""Purple Rain""-- but it didn't stop their music & respect in the industry. Pt 2 is a great album. The success is going to stagger more than Pt 1. There was a 6 yr wait for Pt 1 opposed to a 6 month wait for Pt 2. Ppl are going to wait for Christmas and after seeing JT on tour to get Pt 2. It will eventually sell it's millions like Pt 1 in time. ;)"
LOL
"She kill me with that coochie?!? Well, damn.."
lol
ur pretty
"Holy Crap, I cracked up when I read that!! LOL

I raped the repeat button 
I know I bought mine and I love it.The critics are idiots how can they not like JT compared to all the other garbage out there
"Jod, maybe?"

"Justin I love you, your music is increible"
ทีเคโอ
"Dudes a beast... Good stuff JT.. I can club to this shit!! 
"
Timberland produces some of the best songs.   All of the autotuned EDM that has been plaguing the radio airwaves all sounds the same.  This is a big breath of fresh air of how pop/r&b/hip-hop actually sounded when it was really good.
Each new song he makes is my new favorite!!
Gerbils unite!! 
*  -  * genial D:!
7 minutes is not long at all. If the song's good then make it long! Personally I prefer metal and a lot of songs can go that long so I'm also used to it.
Love it
I hate tht he makes his songs soooooooooo damn long
Dammit babe! Dammit babe! Dammit babe! Da-Da-Da-Dammit Babeeee! Love that part...well love the entire song. :)
lmfao!!!
"Holy Grail is not his song though, it is Jay Z's...."

Super bien la musique
Just Amazing

It is. It was released as a single last week. :)
WE NEED VIDEOOOO!!!!!
Coochie cooo hahaha
I just really love JT :)
that intro 
YOUTUBE/watch?v=vBKQrrmLsLQ
"Intro sucks, rest of the song is on point."
"This seriously brought back to the early 2000's, when Justin just came out with his album ""Justified,"" and that was an AMAZING album."
this song should be his next single <3
My husband. I listen to this song all day
TEDDY PENDERGRASS
Like this if you came from shane 
"If there was a drug called JT, I'd do JT."
"Am i the only one who's missing justin doing some wild vocals??. ""for example like in the end of ""gone, loosing my way etc...? :) I am talking about the whole album! :D (still good though)"
Omg I love this!
Timberland is the mastermind behind this!!! That beat is everything!!!! #YES
"his performance last night was A1, mayweather was right "" best for last """
timbo makes the sickest beatz
THESE LYRICS ARE TRUE!
@Peter Hentges and Sean A. Sutton: you could not have said it better guys. TKO is a BLAST!!! And one can only give props to the true professionals that Timberland and JT are. They truly compliment each other.
"He is a total bad ass, a true professional and he does it again. Excellent Mr.Timberlake Best entertainment of the century. 
Sincerely,
Sean"
"Lol! Maybe secretly this is supposed to be about Meg, just no one figured it out. Thank you for finding out the secret."
"5:34 sounds like they're saying ""damnit meg"""
Booooooooooooo..song is horrible
"Timbo & JT have got to be one of the best musical partnerships ever!   ""Lights out,TKO,Freaky Freaky Freak...Boom""  Hahaha
"
He is so sexy :D
Ty Shane Dawson
Damn! It's possible that JT & Timbo recycled the beat. Check /watch?v=NqGHtoYDTMc The song is sick anyway!
Part of the beat sounds like my guinea pigs
TKO means technical knock out buuuut timberlake knock out is cool too
guinea pig squeakies?
nobody wins if your heart is swole :(
Or maybe Timberlake Knock Out x)
True. But I think it should stand for Timberlake Knock Out
my new workout song :D
"That in croatian means ""Who?"""

I don't fucking care who brings you here
Came here because Shane
no one ever talks about the justin timberlake fandom because the WHOLE WORLD is the justin timblerake fandom
"correction,,  if they dont go to #1,  then somebody has no taste..."
"#2 of 2 is awesome...if cant drink you away, or amnesia,  or tko  go to #1,  then somebody has no taste ...those are awesome songs......so is  its not a bad thing.."
You do realize that Tim produced part 1 of the album right? He didn't go anywhere
Another Hit !
Man I love Justin. This nigga is ALWAYS on.
I actually really feel this song. It's amazing
this is amazing!!!
Timberlake and Timbaland are the dynamic duo.
"If it helps any, the clean version cuts out Timbaland saying that. :D Just listen to that one instead, haha."
the math says people love shit more than good music
Yes he does
I hear guinea pigs. Guinea pigs!!
I love his music and he definitely came back strong with his new songs. Elizabeth k.

I love it
I swear.... Every time him and Timbaland get together... Their songs are MAGIC. Goddamn
regardless of the quality and the 2 songs man the girl cant sing for her life nor can the one at the top and they have nothing to do with music  but they can strip and no one will care what they hear 
like if your here because of shane dawson :)
True
He finally got back with Timbaland!!! Jay Z needs to go somewhere
Mirrors is my only favorite song from him... all of his other songs are failures no offence..
Who cares about charts? Apparently not JT... People listen to what ever they want.  In my opinion TKO is better than Work Bitch (which sounds very much like other songs out there) I guess that's why it's #12.
Like This Song is so PRO LIKE
TKO opens at 54 on the hot 100 while Britney opens at 12 with work b*  huh you do the math 
swag on you !
like if shane dawsons video brought you here
WTF!!!! 449 dislikes......are u people deaf!!
"love this and i soooo love j.t, my all time hero ! <3 :)"
This song is really good like if u agree ;)
Thats timbaland
"venez voir notre chaîne, on est des jeunes danseurs de hip hop , nous avons besoin de soutiens  ! ♥"
"0:00 my pc was krashed by replay 
"
he is singing like a boxer lol
"SAME SUB ME !!!!!!!!
"
Love this song. Great Singer and actor
What did Timberland said in 0:00????!!
Yeaaah :D
people.. whats goin on? enjoy the song and shut the fuck up..
Damn thats fucked up is that what he's been doing and causing someone to say whats going on in the comment.
"For the record, I streamed the entire 20/20 pt 2 album on iTunes...I liked this individual song so I'm youtubed it ...and I'm sure whoever that dude was will eventually go back to his life time supply of lotion, napkins and porn mags and get down to business...but I'll deff look up this Shane Dawson everyone's talking about"
"So im a little confused here, you say I look 13, yet I aslo look old enough to have lost my virginity? Huh. Okay, and you also seem to know when I got my license?  Clever boy. Now why dont you take your charm and wit elsewhere, mkay"
"Some people were harmlessly saying where they heard about this song- not a crime last I checked- and that mrcalloway92  guy starting calling everyone morons and children. Idk man. But if you scroll down, youll see comment after comment of hate from him. Did I mention he made fun of autism too? Cause he did. "
"Im not, but thats irrelevant.  If youre 21 then isnt it kinda sad that your wasting your time being a dick to people in the comments section of a Justin Timberlake video? "
"YOUR PROFILE PIC IS A FREAKING SOUTH PARK CHARACTER JUST 
LEAVE ALREADY. goddam kid youre so obnoxious. Really? Making fun of autistic kids? Just GO. "
"Dude are you just on here to piss people off? You said I was an idiot for whatever reason so I came back here to reply and what do I find? Reply after reply of people calling you an ass for spouting random hate. Youre most likely 11 so im not going to waste my time scolding you. But, for everyones sake, gtfo please. "
"PREACH. Funny, because I just went back to this video because he said the same bs to me. What a Jerk -.-"
This song is awesome! The instrumentation is perfect and of course JT does what he does.
"Like! 
"
Justin is the king of long songs that still feel like they aren't long enough. Love this song. <3
Love this song
"Everyone stop bitching! It's a song! Yes I looked It up because of Shane Dawson.
Justin Timberlake!"
Wahnsinn... Musik die beim ersten mal hören einen umhaut! POWER !
This the problem wit people these days music cant be music without people being Stereotype smh no wonder why the world is full of hate
i agree with Jake wth??? what nobody feeling this song it's a great song so what's with all the bull crap THIS IS NOT A CHAT ROOM
sHaNe BrOuGhT mE hErE!!
"M-tow,"

Shane brought me here
"sounds good to me !        Justin out did himself on #2 of 2 ...    ##...very very impressive ...some beautiful songs (amnesia and thats not a bad thing)     mixed in with a little funk ....
"
Anyone else think there's a guinea pig noise in the background? I swear that's what it sounds like lol
"I'm going to piss off that specific jackass by spamming SHANE DAWSON SHANE DAWSON SHANE DAWSON SHANE DAWSON SHANE DAWSON!!!!!!! Not like I'll look back down at the comments of this amazing song to see a typical insult of that one asshole, who is a waste of perfectly good amount of atoms and particles, calling me a faggot, queer, or some other predictable remark. So, I say my happy farewells, realizing that looking back isn't worth the energy I could use watching one of my most beloved youtubers."
Look at the world now people arguing for no reasons... Are loved ones looking down at us and I don't think they would like how everyones is acting
this page was about music until spammers showed up they are turning youtube into twitter fail
Shut up both of u
Justin's song is amazing no surprise all of his songs are amazing
King of Popppppp
"Personally, I came here to hear a good song. This SONT"
What's even happening in the comments?
"making fun of autistic kids, where you born without a heart. Autistic kids are better, smarter and happier than you will ever be. Are you so miserable that you spend your time insulting people on the internet . Grow up and find a better hobby"
"He made funny review of this song, just search Shane Dawson on youtube"
Ah the white knight of the comment section.
Shane made this sound waaaaaay better lol (:
love it tbh
"Sucessful music carreer, amazing movie carreer, beautiful wife. Now time for them babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! loool "
"Justin Timberlake, never ever be embarassed that you were in The Michey Mouse Club and Nsync. Look where you are today. Michey Mouse Club was a sucess, Nsync took the world by storm. You are by far one of the most talented, raw talent, pure talent, definition of talent. Im a young 20 year old female fan and will be till the day i die"
Nope.

This song is simply awesome!!! :) JT makes HITS
WOW this is the JT we want!!!
"You came to the wrong side #Bitch.
This is JT team."
379 morons! Water ....cause they have no taste
"This beat makes me freaking out!! Can't stop dancing"""
I like the backround guinea pig
this is wery good  song kv danni örninn iceland!!! LIKE THIS UP :):):):):):)
the music is better after five minutes
Bet Britney is shitty they broke up
"Justin co-produces all of his music, not strictly singing."
TIMBALAND! Timberland make shoes and clothes...
Lol he used a guinea pig sound in the track
"Is it just me, or did JT use a guinea pig's whistling in this song?"
it's actually Timbaland!
AWESOME !!!
at first i thought it was charlie sheen hahaha
"Dear Mr. Critic, plz verify your credibility. Just like you, I also like to ""review"" every video I can find out there, for better or for worse. The difference is that I have a profile picture to verify my credibility. The ball is now on your side of the court. Thank you, fellow ""Critic"""

MEEEE TOOOOOO!!!! :FL AJRETOU H%#LT
"If anyone wants the instrumental to TKO, there's one on my channel. I actually think it's the only one on youtube... haha. Don't I feel special.

I CAN'T FREAKING WAIT FOR THIS ALBUM TO DROP!"
"""Music Critic/ Music Expert"" haha good one... Just a YouTube troll hiding behind an account with no pic or videos hahaha..."
"I agree with Barry, JT plays piano, guitar, drums etc. Even beat boxes... JT is a musician.... haters gonna hate..."
Love it
I like it! love u man. Waiting the video clip. #Brazil.
I only like half of the chorus
No one is saying that. You made that up so this comment would seem intelligent.
Timberlake Knock Out
"If you don't like his songs then gtfo. Watch the other vids on this channel, he says that he writes when he wants about what he wants."
Well Put It Like This....Anytime JT and TIMBALAND Colab...They Make Hits Its Obvious From FutureLove Sounds - 20/20 Experience 1
"Dumbass do you realise he plays piano, guitar, drums, writes & produces his own music so how is he not a musician??? And you call yourself a critic?? As ""critic"" shouldn't you know that??"
Someone said JTs album flopped? ROTFL UR NUTZ! JT is ruling the charts bishes!
Tight song
"That awkward moment when it's impossible for someone to TKO somebody, you have to submit for a TKO. "
Quem é do Brasil e ta vendo da um joinha aew ^^
I love you 333
"Really sounds like guinea pigs in the background :/
"
I listened to the free stream on iTunes yesterday at least 4 times honestly Part 2 is better than Part 1 the sounds remind me FutureSex/LoveSound in a lot of ways.
"Really cool song well done  ;)
"
Até o JT curte Funk! kkkkkkkkkkkkk
What a moronic and blatantly obvious lie.
"uuhh, I think he is! ahha just not officially! I think majority of people agree (:"
amazing! looovee some JT!
How could anyone be this perfect <3 love you Justin!
"You are a legend, Justin. Mad love for you, sir."
"I'm afraid this wont be a #1 in any chart.
ALL HOPES FOR #CABARET"
"""Not a musician he is not!"" - This, coming from some ""Music Expert?"" Who do you think you're foolin', dude? Run along and go play a nice game of hide and go fuck yourself! Thanks... ;-)"
Me too! I'm trying not to hear the songs from the album because I want to be surprised but it's being pretty difficult. 
great song JT is the best
Very dumb statement! As A Music Critic/ Music Expert At Rolling Stone Magazine in 13 Different Genres (Mainstream & Underground) I'm trained to evaluate and analyze music objectively. JT is a good artist but not the best music entertainer in mainstream music. Not a musician he is not! Musicians use instruments!
Justin is boss.
I told my sister the same thing she about lost her mind 
thanks
Justin Timberlake can be in Top Comments in his own channel! WE HEART JT!
JT Co Produces with him give JT credit too!!!
Technical Knockout :D
"Lol, she kill me with that coo coochi-coochi-coo ??"
"People don't get that JT co-produces all of his tracks. Alongside timberland. So, JT deserves all the credit for his big hit. I hate how ppl are saying its only cause of Timberland!"
"#15 on iTunes. Needs to be #1. C'mon people. I got my copy, do u??"
i love you justin. your sound is CRRAZy good
"lindo lindo tema
"
Technical knockout
What does TKO stand for ? 
Every Justin Timberlake fan needs to give credit TIMBALAND who is responsible for nearly all of JT's hits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That weird noise in the background sounds like a guinea pig aha
Yes I know it....
Technical knock out!
Ludacris sucks? Girl please sit down.
Damn so good ! 
JT is the best musician / artists living these days ! Honestly a legend! A performer an entertainer *hands down* Big respect! 
SO AMAZAYN!!!!! x'D
KO
What's tko?
It is! And that's saying a lot considering how much I love part 1.
HAHA it sounds like guinea pigs in the background! Love the song though!
guinea pig backup vox ftw.
"I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!
"
SARCASM.
it is if you have an itunes ID or i think if not its still free
"If it's a TKO, why is he out for the count?"
JT's music never seizes to amaze me! He's one of the best artists from the 21st century!
Love this song!! :)
Hit after hit passionately impressing anyone that listens to music. You can't be better than jt
JT IS BACK!!!!
omg!
"It's streaming for free on iTunes, JT tweeted a link yesterday."
fucking cool <3
This is the bomb. 
"we're in 2013  or 2006 ,,,, I thought Justin was releasing songs from the 20/20 experience ,not from Future sex/ love sound  or Justified ,,,, this guy  still has not receive the 2010's , I think he lives in the 2000's yet ,,, ugh ....."
um it's not free lol
lol you have to wait 
"yay you,love dis song gonna listen to it all day and put it on replay!"
"You do know that ""he"" also creates all of the sick beats/sounds/eargasms in the background right? People should give Timbaland some credit, because he's a big part of these songs."
MUSIC VIDEO PLEASE RELEASE NOW!!! 
This is my JAAAYUM!!!!!!!!
"like what exactly is the point of your cmmnt? Like what, really?"
Why would you change perfection?
He killing it. Just listen to part 2 it amazing
He kill it.
OMG! I LOVE HIM<3 his music never disappoints;)
"And he says only ""Gucci Gucci Gu""and he gets million of dollars xD wtf..."
EAR PORN!!!! Who else broke their replay button?
"I'm obsessed with ur music JT, like an addict! I need my fix, this song is my crack"
Lol you really felt insulted by the word idiot you must have really thin skin 
"Sick, dirty, sexy, funky! Just plain out of control."
porquinho da india kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
"LOVE IT! Timbaland is on the track too :)
"
The quiet after the storm
this new album. No words 
"How there was no hip-hop verse in this song, I will never know. Suits the beat so fucking much. "
And JT come back
"I BE ON MY SUIT AND TIE SHIT, TIE SHIT"
"Great Job ! Call me a name, make an assumption, and critique my well-entitled opinion. However, don't bother making any sense. If you had read correctly, you would know that I was referring to his ""sound"" not him. It's more of a production thing. "
I think it might be better than Part 1 honestly
Just heard the entire Part 2 of The 20/20 Experience there isn't one bad song on the album I think it might even better than Part 1.
"JT is just tearing it UP and inspiring me to be the BEST i can in everything i do!! :) keep it goin JT, you rock President of Pop!"
"only thing i dont like is that coochie coo line, everything else is fine. "
This song is amazing!!!!
No scam easy making money for generating traffic just one simple click on this link and all you have to do is generate trafic..
"He's really back!
"
LMMFAO If that's the dumbest thing you've ever read you must not read your own posts LMMFAO 
So you have to be innovative and change music in order to be considered a genius???? Yeah your logic makes perfect sense NOT that is the dumbest shit I have ever heard 
"Hahahaha, word."
technical knockout
I LOVE HIM I LOVE HIS MUSIC!!!!!
"Yes, and his whole album is streaming now on iTunes for FREE before one week of its release."
TKO is on the 20/20 part 2
Best sound EVER!!!! Amazing...
is TKO included on The 20 /20 Experience album?
TKO means Technical Knock out.  It's a boxing term.  
"you guys are all wrong, tko means ""guinea pig squeal"" ... oh wait"
OMG thanks!!! But itunes keeps crashing for some reason -.-
whats is TKO ?
excellent production #TKO
Ok how are ppl listening to 20/20 part 2??????
Technical knockout
3 3 3
I think TKO stands for Timberlake Knock Out. Point out if im right but this is what I think. :/
Check out my Justin Timberlake Video on my channel! Homage to a great performer!
TKO = technical knockout.. when the ref has to stop the fight
Fodaa d mais o som
Total knock out
What does TKO stand for? Love thing btw!!! Been a huge JT fan since Nsync
I know that feel bro :)
"They stole the beat from Short Dawg's ""You Know I'm Fresh"" feat. Bun B. lol. Incredible."
"i love this, its perfection :)"
"3-5 mins,but not 7."
GREAT SONG!!
Awesome!!
"Mirrors Nr1. 
"
Freaking awesome! Another masterpiece as usual by JT! Fan from Malaysia. :) xx
<3
The last track on 20/20 2 of 2 made me cry. Especially the hidden track. :') God bless this man.
Google it.
new single...
"God Dammit i like it  !!!! So Fresh!!!
"
im listening to it right now its THE BEST album EVER
"During the VMAs he was obviously out of breath since he was going from stage to stage dancing and singing all over Barclay's Center.... He is amazing live, Legends of the Summer was incredible! "
"Anyone else hear the guinea pigs in the background?
"
"355 idiotas!!
Justin = MONSTRO"
"OMG I just heard the new album on Itunes, ITS A MASTERPIECE! There is not one track that I dislike."
First track is crazy on the 20/20 part 2
Unbelievably the best artist to walk this earth.
FODASTICCA *-*
"It is so so GOOD, haven't decided on a favorite yet...Murder is wow, Trueblood, Cabaret, Only when I walk Away.. incredible album "
"oh i want to buy it, just not from itunes. they'll never get my business. "
My favorite song by u!
We get our money's worth.
"you say that, yet according to your profile, you like his songs... the fuck."
you're a fucking hater
Are u serious JT doesn't do good live. Just YouTube 2013 VMA awards please....
You don't have to buy it! They are just streaming the whole album for free!!!
"JT is in genius mode with this album, so incredible!"
"thank you for bringing back real music jt
"
Dat guinea pig sound :P
Coochie coo... :S
"When it first starts, you know its going to be good."
"strangely I don't Like it....
Usually Love Your Music.... iono... 
Loved 20/20 Experience Tho :D except for that bonus track which just changed the feel of the whole album #BodyCount (should have had a buildup into it cz it js felt different)"
JT N TIMBO!!!! its that change up though.. he has literally owned the art of changing up a track - Timbo is god of a producer - these two are insane together!!!
WE GOT A KINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
"2,001 comment"
This guy has so much talent
Pas mal
Love it.
new michael jackson
just recalled what other song of his had the guinea pigs   # my love
I FUCKING LOVE THIS.
Everyone go to iTunes and take a listen to the 20/20 experience. It's so great. Loving track #1 so much!
"nah, not as good as JT and The Neptunes"
"iTunes. That's a good enough ""link"". "
"Ur beats go though my chest, perfect hit to the dome! Boom!!!"
THANKS! :)
I love it.  But I do question whether it needs to be 7 minutes long.
JT's 20/20 Experience part 2 is streaming in FULL of iTunes! GO LISTEN TO IT IT'S GOOD. 
omgggggg I didn't even think I could get more in love with JT but it just happened!!
Parece q hay un cuy infiltrado en la cancion  :P
Tune!
what itunes chart r u talking about havent seen this song on any chart 
two words: amaz-ing!!
Yesss I need this next CD if it's up beat like this song . Pt one isn't doing it for me
"why should i buy on itunes, when i despise anything that has to do with Apple? sorry, but i'd rather buy from somewhere else OTHER than itunes."
"It's not his official account, his vevo account is official, and he is just returning back after a few years of not singing. As soon as his next album comes out he will top the charts easily"
Goochie goo? Haha cute
TKO = technical knock out?
Because everyone talked about her and how horrible the video was and how stupid humans are we wanted to check out the video
I'm sure it'll go up to #1 when the music video is released
Katy Perry isn't that bad tho
"pretty sad that this masterpeice only gets 1 million views in 3 days, yet miley can get 20 in 1 day :("
vary god song
This is how long most of his music has been tho
"I love you, Justin Timberlake... You are God..."
T'es KO?
"before ""20/20 experience part one"" people where saying who the fuck are justin and timbaland they cant make hits anymore... justin and timbo are class artists they will never make bad music  only hits everytime they colaborate!!!kILLLING IT!!! they are not like these one year lasting artists!!!KINGS!!!TOP COMMENT BYE HATERS BYE!!!!"
"TKO'D ;)
"
1 mill in 3 days :)
AMEN
technical knock out
Check out my cover of TKO on my channel
I actually was thank you 
I wouldn't say he's doing anything innovative. Genius to me are the guys that change music or the way we look at music. 
How is he not a genius though please answer that 
Why you mad bro?
Technical Knockout
"And by ""song long"" I meant ""so long"" lol"
"This song has 2 parts - like most of his songs, that's why they are song long. If u can't understand that JT song style then why are u here?!"
"Yeah girl, you knock me out "
"I like it when Justin complements women while delivering substance. Makes me feel all Gucci inside. 
I can see why Justin could be like Michael, in that he is well liked and loved for his music, therefore he is The King of Pop for our generation. "
7min is pretty long. most songs are 3-4 min 
Ohh thanks :3
The hell are you talking to yourself? and what is Justin Bieber? Is it a new name of shoe? I'd like to wear it.
Love it !  Another amazing song by Justin Timberlake
"Justin is back, and he is staying!!!! Cannot wait for the new album!!!!!! And there is only one Justin Timberlake, and he will be the only one!!!"
Amazing song ♥
If you think 7 mins is a long song you need to listen to more music haha.
His are all so good!
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe he has done it again."
I can just smell the Grammy's!! 
Why the fuck would you complain about it? 
GO HARD JT!! 
His new songs are soooo long!
Pure perfection.... Jt and timbo... Genius...
IVLOVE THE SONG
It Means Fuck You :)
"hats off, sir"
perfect song with perfect sound ! 
"He's back.....oh wait, he never went anywhere! Been looking forward to this album for the past month. "
sorry i don't like the beginning :/ the rest is beautiful thoughhh
If that means Tokyo?
Justin & Timbaland..best combo ever..!! :D
...... ?????
"Go check out our version of Justin's "" Cry Me A River""

Starting my day off with a TKO!
The mouth sounds remember Pentatonix.
Lyrics are fantastic beats are mindblowing...forever gonna love JT! GREAT STUFF!
I swear this song grows in you :D
IGNORE HATER~ HATER GONNA HATE~
JT you never fail to amaze me. 3
I love the song !! And I love JT of course
"Omg such an idiot, I´m not the only one who disliked Bieber the whole world dislike him, and haah he can suck his dollars cares, the problem is only girls like him and i fuck the girls who wants him 
and last fuck you, too!!!!!"
It's not JT beat boxing tho. It's Timbaland on the outro.
"El mejor de los mejores, sin duda JT no tiene techo.
"
Let's help Justin to get #1! Buy on iTunes!
<3 
I loveë it
Like I wrote before. Thanks Justin 4 your music and lyrics. We love real Justin Timberlake. not another plastic Justin Timberbieber and other clones. :)
i looooove it
Obsessed. 
Really? Remember when she was named the sexiest woman alive?
This track is sick. Can't wait for the album. Timberlake/Timberland have done it again! :)
God damn the man can do no wrong.
"Right before I realized what it stood for, I thought it was ""total knockout""."
"Nope, she's in the past. He's moved on. The song doesn't have to be about a personal experience... "
Yes you are.
Technical Knock Out!
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH DAMMIT!!!! The bitch is done!
"Really, I hate to call people idiots, but you didn't know what TKO meant? 
A boxing theme? Total Knock Out?"
Dude is an absolute beast
Am I the only one who had to urban dictionary what TKO was? 
Cue JT's beat boxing skills!
This song is on another level!
I'm bit here to hate on MJ but he's gone now. JT is the it thing right now. Everything he does us inspired by MJ. But no king lives forever. #JustRemember
Judging by the first two singles it seems like 2 of 2 might be way better than the first half of The 20/20 Experience :)
"The suns gonna shine, the birds gonna fly and the HATERS GONNA HATE."
Cry me a river was about her
obviously whoever wrote this never had a pet guinea pig before..  lol I just can't listen to it
amazinggggggggggg
"Call him ""gay"" all you want but remember that he dated Cameron Diaz and he's married to Jessica Biel. Let that sink in. "
"People moan like fuck, and they wonder why the worlds fucked! How can you moan about 
this?"
Fucking sick of mustached bieber making bullshit songs. This shit sucks like the rest of his songs
Prob will grow on me
This album is going to be amazing!!!
It's okay. It's no TKO. Justin posse can stop posting overly positive reviews.
Awesome
its cringe worthy justin needs to divorce this guy theyve been together for so long he is just wasting his talent 
"Wouldn't surprise me. Gaye had massive impact. Again, not saying JT sucks in any way. And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. Not a bad thing to lose. I just don't see it as genius at the moment. That's all. No need for the hate. "
Ewwww timbaland's coochie coo is a no no. That word already makes me cringe but hearing him say it puts it on a wole other grossness.
I see u there TIMBOO!!
People are so rude I am here to listen to a Timberlake song and I am a belieber and I love Bieber but you don't have to say rude things about him just enjoy this wonderful Justin Timberlake song please
god he is fucking sexy!!
Love love love this song!
"Uhm, he's completely over her... 'cause he's married to the love of his life. Jessica Biel"
"Thanks for being born Justin, love u!!!"
this is fucking awesome. THUMBS UP FOR JUSTIN!!!
"Why would it be? Over 10 years, I'd think they'd BOTH be over each other..."
please more haters to give this legend some viewers ^_^
Omg 4 real ppl. Stop the bs! Not worth the time. If u don't like the song then watch something else.
"14 year wasted , with a woman who never loved me.  Thanks FOOL"
"I know it was Timbaland, I was asking her because she was claiming that is was Justin."
nop :))
Geart！
yessss! thought i was the only one who heard it
lol even though JT doesn't need them.. 
I think I have one of the first cover of this song up right now! Please Come check it out JT fans! =]
One of his best songs
JT PLEASE come to Mexico! You and your music are just amazing
Timbaland still got it tho.
So ready for this album
What did his fans do?
that movie sucks cock
Increibleeeee
"I like JT, but just like every other fanbase of everything (from xbox, lady gaga, etc), the fans makes me not enjoy his stuff as much. 

Good song though, definitely can't wait for the album. "
he nailed it!!!
"yes, especially in Edison! :P"
just let them ;) it just gives our idol more views! 
"Step off haters, why do you even bother to comment, if you don't like his music..his fans know he is one of the best ever, Pop Royalty, and worthy successor to MJ's legacy!! "
"t.k.o cheers, justin timberlake is best, really president of pop, who's with me"
"Um not, that's your opinion. But the rest of us would rather hear the 7 mins... More JT!! "
thank you thank you !
"All JT haters better get out of here, if you don't like JT why are you clicking on his video?? "
I like the beat and rhythm of this song
"uh paid comments, im out of this conversation. see u soon :* "
"i cant agree he is the ONLY artist who got MJ influence in him. What about Beyonce? She also mentions how big inspiration is MJ to her. You can hear it in her music, you can see it in her videos, shows :) 
Anyway, JT deserves the title of the king. Noone else."
"No, it's Timbaland."
"so what? shuddup and enjoy ;o
"
Well that would be funny now...but yeah it's in the song  :)
":) ..but its still important that we discuss his new video because it manipulates entire generations into a sick direction, michael had it at heal the world, this is opposite of everything he did for us."
Did justin timberlake say coochie-coo in this song?
"the fool is unstoppable, hes so many threats!"
Love it
"""‘If Michael Jackson’ was alive to see me dance, he would agree I’m easily as good as he was.”
Bieber said that during tour. Just so you know."
Google it.
I JUST LOVE JT!!!!!!! BEST ARTIST BY FAR♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡
No Justin Bieber never said that at all.
oh nevermind
"""the knock out"""
Michael never said coochie-coo or made a lollypop song. so id say the kind of pop should be left alone cuz it had to do with his heart and soul as a person he was a king.
HEYYY CHECK OUT JUSTIN SINGING LIVE TKO ON MY CHANNEL :)
Amazing song. But am i the only one who thinks that this song is about Britney?
I think he's talking about musicians of this generation... JT has said he's been inspired by Marvin Gaye
Hahaha ad if you dont know what tko stands for
Geil
Perfect!!
"No one's hating on him. Someone who is a music genius? Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, etc, etc, etc. No wait needed. "
Because JT is a class act 
I agree totally!
Love JT but Timbaland is so tired and needs to retire already. 
This sounds so 2006.....
I'm not a fan but I have to say he is great.a legend
And JT goes in hard again!

"He's a performer! He always says bitch or switches the lyrics because ""Cry Me A River"" is a break up anthem...

Britney is not the only one that cheated on him.. For example Cameron Diaz..."

Depp is a great actor, but JT is still 32 years old and still learning acting, i can see him a high profile actor in the future, and remember my words.
"
"JT is the only artist from today music who got MJ influence in him, he was in a boyband and then he succeeded in his solo career just like MJ, he's following MJs steps and he makes a tribute for the king in every concert of his. And he always mention the king MJ's name with love and respect.
They asked JT if he consider himself the next MJ,and he said:""no no, i don't think anybody, MJ is the best

What did that kid JB say when they ask the same Q? He said ""yes i think I'm the next MJ""

That's why he is and will always be special."
Tes super tous ce que tu fait est super dommage que tu te soi marier avec l'autre moche snif
dat beat in the end makes him so special :) 
Hey we all have our own musical tastes no need to apologize doll
legend is back ! 
justin snde bozdun amk nerde eski albümler amk.
total knockout
what does TKO mean?
But his long endings are always so good! 
I like  *o* ! 
I swear all of JT song endings always go so hard. They could be songs on to themselves 
"Agree, second half is better! (It's the hypnotic melody)"
TKO
"Hearing the same song again and again :'D ! Great job , Justin . "
"J.T is definitely THE best,no doubt"
Holi sheat i love you TKO *__*
"This IS rather Lackluster of a production in comparison to some of the material from 20/20 pt.1. Something about it is 2 dimensional and atonal. The progression doesn't take me anywhere or tell any sort of narrative. It's immediately similar to tunnel vision, and that song is so much more rich with layer and melody. 
I will accept this, but it's not spectacular.
I do like the second half a lot though. Very fun an interesting.   "

this song is already on #6 on ITunes!!!! Now that is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
This song is F***ing sick! I just uploaded a cover! Come give it a listen yall. Once again another hit JT
"you're amazing JT, really, I'm in awe of you....<333"
Hmmmmm .....like the song but not wow .....compared to the songs in 20/20 exp part one .............. love take back the night from part 2 but hope that other songs will not hve this typical Timberland sound ...... 
"Justin is the only male R&B singer who is able to get away with 7min plus songs! #Greatness

I LOVE YOU JUSTIN!!!!
"Yes, Justin I agree you run this Bitch!!!

In the background it sounds like a guinea pig squeaking.

"yo jt! keep telling people to vote for you for the EMAs. you need to get some awards this year. you will definitely win at the American Music Awards.

i love this song!
Love you <3 
"justin timberlake's style is kind of a unique paradox because he has a pop songwriting style, with the short verses and many choruses/bridges etc., but the length and arrangements of the music is definitely not pop/radio friendly, its like a hybrid of a pop and art"
Love the song!! You are always awesome JT Love you now and forever
Why are his songs always sooo long!
Only JT's songs are usually more than 5 mins long :D AMAZING as always!
You are an idiot. To say JT is stagnant means you don't really know much about music. Have you listened to 20/20 experience part 1? It's different than any of his old stuff. Idiot.
It's a good song. Who cares if it has a similar sound to some other stuff he's done? That shit was good too!
Da sind ja Meerschweinchen zu Hören !! 
Why does his sound always remain so stagnant? It's like constant deja vu. This is 2005-06 redux. It's time for a change.   
çok komikmiş amk
"You can't rush perfection, JT's songs are a musical experience to be savored..."

Still believe Future Sex/Love Sounds is much better. :(
"If you think it's so ridiculous why even bother listening? And btw, his older songs were long too. Like ""What Goes Around.../...Comes Around"" That song was 7 minutes and 28 seconds, and it was from 2006. So Justin Timberlake having long songs is nothing new. And FYI, it's not ridiculous"
"I'm an r&b SINGER. Not looking to spam, but looking to share real art with others.  - I hate spamming, but I'll do what's needed to get good music out. Give me a thumbs up so others can see.  - We need that ""good ol days"" feeling back to music.   - Real, true, creative music can be found on my channel. SUBSCRIBE to take this journey with me.  THANK YOU, from my heart!"
JUSTIN TE AMO PANA :(
Adorei! 
"Why are all his new songs so ridiculously long for no reason? Literally, it adds nothing to the song. I think I'd enjoy it more if it was short and to the point."
Nothing special!

I am so happy that I am living on the Earth at the same time with JT and Timbo.
Sounds cool :)
OMG!!!!.....This song is freaking awesome!!!....Hit after hit....can't wait until his new movie and the second part of his new album.....JT freaking rocks!.....Luv ya Justin! #justinfan4life

and because he hasn't jumped on the Dance/House influenced Pop that a bunch of other artists are doing. thank goodness. I'm really liking this.
JT for you. hit after hit. this song reminds me of Chop me Up off the Futuresex/Lovesounds album. Great song. JT RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!
T'es K.O. ??? 
Great song.Lets making hit number one 
Very Very good music...

Meu maridoo
@dududisch yes!! You don't have to keep hitting repeat! Lol
The reason I love JT=I'm sick of everyone else using autotune
Vicieii
"agree! I LOVE that his songs are this long... why do ppl even complain? you get more out of one single track and a song like this won't get boring... go listen to some progressive rock bands, where 7 mins-songs seem TOO SHORT."
Be sure that I'm not the only one who disrespects bieber.
"That is Your fact,  and sure you made it up to make you feel more satisfied..Keep making up lies. Because your trolling is so cute."
you have thousands of apps to download music man.
Don't talk about Bieber here please ... the garbage we just throw away.
How sad... You'll never know what good music really is.
JT and Timbo the perfect combination /
I salute you man
Justin Timberlake is 1000000 Times better than that slutty bieber
Shout out Gucci Mane though
"not bad not bad. aint blown me away though. Still bussing a wicked beat and rinsing out the chorus of his song. Good but not great, com'n JT STEP IT UP NOW!"

Another amazing song of the New King of Pop!
so addicted to it!!! can't wait for the album!! :)
I should post a Timberlake song on my page. Damn! This is obviously not Timberlake's official page. Still so much traffic. 
THE SAME SCAM I'VE SEEN! .. DONT GET SCAMMED BEWARE!
"I love it when JT makes this second, another, different sounding part of the song just like he did here, in 'Mirrors' and ""What goes around comes around'.*,*"
this is justin! i just love justin!
I familiar with pharrell's discography that's just his biggest hit of late.  
"How is it possible to be so musically perfect ? i mean, when I listen to another songs, I never feel what I feel when I listen to Justin Timberlake... It's crazy, and unique. There must have bit of magic in that sound."
Justin Timberlake give me orgasm in my ears
Love it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. Already know the lyrics❤❤❤❤❤❤
Total knock out..  duh.....
Justin Timberlake is untouchable. 
JT always only you
JT super !!!!!
Technical Knock Out
Total Knock Out
Awesome
Great song Jay keep up the work and can't wait for the next JT and Timbo Combo
"Aww, poor you, keep dreaming about Justin & Spears, just keep dreaming.
You just can't accept the fact that, Justin is married now and he said that he wrote all the songs on his new albums for his wife Jessica Biel. "
Another JT banger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good news!
This song has two parts like mirrors love how u combine 2 songs in to one :)
"technical knock out

What is TKO>?
"Kkk, I had a guinea pig that had the same little noise that contains all this music .. : P

The beat reminds me of Chop me up
Why does this remind me a lot of Future Sex Love Sounds.
I know his beat from another song
He's Really on a roll 
"Well, already made a cover for this song :) 

... too soon?
watch?v=Gl1t_BbH0Cs"
"lol funny. you obviously know nothing about pharrell if you only know him by ""blurred lines"". this was a waste of time."
man...JT has come a long way...nobody was expecting him to be this successful when he was still with NSYNC in the 90's... 
Technical Knock Out :)
"That's better! This should've been the first single, not TBTN. But hey, at least this song won't be worn out before the album comes out."
So what does tko stands for?
timbaland and justin are amazing together since cry me a riverrr 
Timbaland and JT said Part 2 of the 20/20 Experience would come like a thief in the night and that no one would be ready for it. I just feel sorry for all the other artists that are going to have to scramble to keep up on September 30. Sorry I'm not sorry. 
I NEED it to be September 30th NOW!!!
Never met a Justin timberlake song I didn't like. From justified til now I bang ever song on every album
A platinum
Song is bangin can't wait to hear the rest of this half of 20/20
SO PROUD OF MY BABY LOVE YOU SO MUCH (LEGEND)
Woah... That was AWESOME!!!! :D I love this song!! :DDD

Pretty good
Disappointed.

This song is fucking incredible
I LOVE this song and JT but the beginning with the 'she kill me with her cootchy coo' is really annoying lol
ask JT before u cry!
2nd favorite song-1st still Lovestoned/I Think She Knows Interlude. But it's still pretty awesome!!!!!!!!
Perfect hit to the dome.. every lyrics ive seen is wrong. Why would it say perfect hit til the dawn? That makes no sense.

justin and timbo have worked together since  his first album Justified. He doesn't rely on him they collaborate great together.
"Timbalan has yet to drop Shock Value III early 2014, so probably not."
Is this about Britney?? It's been a long time. Justin should've moved on. Besides he has Jessica Biel.
"I have just been killed with that cooch, coochie coochie coo."
Barclays Center Nov 6th.. can't wait ♥ Second time JT this year :D
sexyback still my fav ;/
Justin is the definition of perfection....i lovs
"What a bad song, lost my time once again with justin"
Awesome once again...
Does anyone else hear a Guinea Pig in the background?

It's JT that's what makes him a beast and king if the mike
"Timberlake's is president of pop

"Jt not tough sings like a 12 year old girl, sucks"
The question is...is he gonna tour with Timbaland
same here. this is amazing

Someone please explain the meaning of TKO?? I love the song overall the meaning behind it is good too. But I just read that they won't play the song on radios in some countries. Wtf. P.S. I wish he wouldn't rely on Timbaland for music. J.T is great himself #justsaying plz no hate

I agree but Suit & Tie is with Jay Z tho
Sounds like gucci mane Timbaland? Or gucci mane?
Totally
Been bumping this all day. The track is sick
No radio will play this
I feel like part 2 is gonna be better than 1-considering that he has a collaboration with Drake and another with JAY Z!!!!
Could b just inspired by Britney ways back in the day
to all you complaing that is not good let me see ya go in to the studio and write songs like this man!
are you deaf?
Because the song is about a girl who betrayed him and was low down and dirty that's why ppl think its about Britney!
DAYUMMM!! This is the sex!!
my lil fangirl heart 
Eh....it's nice just not as great as his other work.
Why does everyone think hes still stuck on Brittney? They broke up and she went crazy while his career flourished. Hes married and has obviously moved on. 
"He is perfect, the song is perfect, the whole album is a crown! Go JT! 3"
Well it's good but not Future Sex Love Sounds good. Maybe it'll grow. Massive JT fan but something has been missing this time round :/
"Wow Tiago if you don't like mirrors you should probably just stick to your Spice Girls. MIRRORS was a masterpiece. JT is on another level now. He made it clear that the second half of the 20/20 Experience was the dark and dirty sister to the first half therefore, this should be different and more edgy."
Especially since they broke up over 10 years ago... :/
JT is so classy again love him so much
"yeah!, This is the JT we knew"
Nice song
"Oh yes, Justin's TKO indeed knocks me out c: love it."
"Perfect head to toe, dame it babe, ur beats just knock me right out! I love how everyone's saying this song is to Britney"

Love the quality of sound!
i love you justin timberlake
This is a hit
This my guy right here.
Justin did it again.
I happen to love the album and my fav songs are NOT any of the singles.. except suit and tie..
Everybody from all over the world i would like to welcome you to our world the new KING OF POP!
"Sooo u name 2 singles on the radio and u say ""all"" songs? There were 12 songs on the album and u only name the first 2 singles... obviously you arent a fan nor have you listened to his album."
Dude!! This is already my fav on 20/20. Check out my cover if you'd like =P
wait her to stand up and baaaaam do it to her RKO randy ortan.fuck this girl and get your right man..... 
Neptunes and Timbaland were on his first album.
ily justin
"Hmm...I love you, Justin, but....this one isn't for me."
Please tell me the name of the song where u heard this beat? O.o
Awesome song! Justin Timberlake > Justin Bieber
"NAJBOLJI SI, JUSTINE! "
Sounds dated
I think justin should make a part 3
Amazing
How could anybody dislike this?
Every song he show us is a major hit! He's so talented and gifted. JT you're my idol and role model! Keep up a good work my men!
I could listen to this song all day... Justins voice just does something to me. Love this.
Timbaland é foda <3 Rei das batidas
haha good answer
So he would have inspiration to make music for REAL artists like J.T.? xD
"""If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin can do 10-minute songs and Queen can do 10-minute songs then why can't we? We'll figure out the radio edits later.""- Justin Timberlake"
why doesn't Timbaland keep producing beats like this instead of those shitty generic pop beats! 
ÜBERRAGEND !!!!
timbaland and j.t. back again sounds like 20/20 is going to be better than the first! 
Can anyone tell me why all of his songs are 6+ mins long....
Like peas and carrots (:
YES there's the bitter JT i've been missing.
I could get pregnant even if all he said was hi... sadly
"I wasn't comparing bodies of work, man. I was talking about the magic that happens when they work together. "
You know..There will be a parody of this song like...i dont know... Randy Orton on the background and have the sign RKO..Just saiyan you know..
"haha, That's what I was about to say."
"well to clarify for you, the difference between JT and Madonna is that he helps co produce and write most of his own music. To blend his producing/writing skills with timbaland and create constant hits damn near every song he drops is in fact, musical genius. Notice how no one else who works with timbaland can recreate the magic JT creates with him."
7:06 song? WTF?
"Prince,Lord,and Master of POP...No one can compare!"
"Check out my channel for beats , 15 year old starter producer :)"
♥♥♥♥♥
This song is just awesomness JT IS THE BEST
I loveed song!!! ♥
Not to mention they made the greatest selling album ever together. Not a comparison you should be making
*_* i love this song.
My favorite song. What a perfect single! ♡ i know justin timberlake know he fine :* ♡♥♡♥
"Hits doesn't == genius. By that logic madonna was a musical genius. As were the wall flowers. JTs great, but music genius is a stretch. "
"Timbaland? being Quincy? ya go research a little before you say things like that..thats pretty offensive to actually say those two names together like that. the Michael one i can sort of understand tho, just because he leads in the pop genre today."
"Oh BTW, JT co-produces all of his tracks on the 20/20"
Love this
my god you'r a genius!!! love love love it!!!!
Justin and Timbaland are our generation's Michael and Quincy Jones. Great combo & genius work! 
"JT AND TIMBO CAN DO NO WRONG IN MY EYES...
"
Why is he using guinea pig squeals in the background...
Does anyone else hear Guinea pigs?
<33
JT is a musical mastermind him & Timbo are a perfect combo of artist & producer.
Foda como sempre!!!
"JT you are awesome ‼ keep it up man 
"
EARGASUM
Yeah !!! #TKO
omg I fricken love this !!!!
"Cool song.  It kind of reminds me of something from Future Sex Love Sounds notably ""Chop Me Up""."
bwahahah
yeah timbaland is great but his songs do sound the same lol. 
im sorry but all his new songs are so baddd..... like they sound the same and are sooo boring!!!! suit and tie was ok thats it and mirrors... everything else is bad 
"Musical genius is fitting considering every song he mad has been pretty much a hit, how man other artists, especially the one who previously worked with timbaland, been able to accomplish that? Besides of course Michael Jackson. How many people are anticipating new music from anyone compared to Justin?"
all his new songs are so bad tho.... like listen to this
"This is too damn gooooood. What a genius you are Justin!
"
Sickkkk
"But then i always wondered why Omarion's song ice box, which was also produced by timbaland and sounds very similar to what he would produce for justin, was no where near as big as most of Justin's songs.

Its not just his producers, its his style, his vibe, his essence, his musical history, hell even helps produce his own songs, thats why whenever he drops something people automatically love it. Timbaland does however play a huge part in it so big ups to him"
I like JT but musical genius is a bit much haha. Now timbaland is up there with great producers. 
Too long
I hear guinea pigs in the beat o.O
THIS SHIT IS CRACK!!!! 
FINALLY!!! We can say JUSTIIIIN and people Think of TIMBERLAKE! Bieber os OUT!! Im in love!
"OMGGG love it, love him <3"
Amazing!
Lourde instrumental !
He* but yeah his producers carry him. He's talented and good but its his producer (Timbaland) that carries into being great
"great beat Timbaland!
"
So fucking awesome
People it's JT beat boxing...
"You know what I respect the most about Justin, is that he stayed true to his style and didn't sell out in his comeback like many artist (Britney, Chris Brown, The Black Eye Peas) to just name a few. Congrats JT to being one of the only classy real artists left. Ur mom did a good job."
Good song! But that beat again -.-
It's called style.
"Amazing song, we could say that the ""old Justin"" is back, but his music has evolved, and it's pretty good. I just love the song, the way he tries to make something change in his carrier. Just go on Justin !"
HOLY♥
MEU IDOLO É O MELHOR!
You don't know what R&B is.
I've listened to this amazin song since JT release it and I'll never stop 
Yes this I a T K O... He has done it again.... He is a winner!!!!
"Another hit, yeaah buddy"
"Okay, JT is amazing... but him just have good producers, that's why him is amazing.
"
Love it
Justin Timberlake = The King of R&B
"Quero o clip!!!!! '¬'
"
Like
Justin is the best ever
"I love JT so much! I have so much respect for his music because it's so unique for our generation. It's not the mainstream 'pop' like we hear from sooo many other artists. His style is so fresh. People need to stop disrespecting Justin Bieber an comparing him to JT. You can't even COMPARE them because they are on two opposite sides of the pop spectrum. Truth is, both JT and JB are grown ups now. Their music is developing and they are becoming the true artists they deserve to be treated like."
I LOVE how his songs are over 3 minutes long. Out of all the albums that came out this summer his is the one I've listened to the most !
"Só eu escutei ""é o pente, é o pente..."" de fundo no final da música?"
The best ♥
"Short Dawg feat. Bun B – You Know I'm Fresh

All Tracks Produced By Timbaland"
"JT always the star,loving him TUNE."
Does the end remind you a bit of when Pacman dies?? :P
Justin Timberlake ft. Guinea Pigs
Me too and I like your picture that is so cute! *smiles*
"Some people just assume that because its the same genre as some of his other songs, the song is exactly the same. They said Take Back the Night was an MJ ripoff when in reality it was just like any other R&B song from the 80s"
Omg !!!!!3
JT is the BEST Justin there is!
"Well Karl, I have liked all of your comments so far...but here I disagree! There is music that we like and dislike, but as much as I love JT I also DO love Taylor Swift! Sorry!! :D"
LOVE IT!! Jt just can't put out anything bad
Just brilliant! Love this so much
This song is awesome
Moxxo
crap
"what a freaking successful man, a true musical genuis, all you other musicians should be ashamed of yourselves !! Letting JT steal the spotlight like this on EVERYTHING he makes"
no
the god of pop
my baddd haha
♡♥ JT forever ♡♥
short dawg used the same exact beat on souther flame spitta 5 track one
omg
"MJ's songs wasn't full of pop either, but they called him the king of pop, so what? ""The Royal pop Family"" will never change no matter what people say:

Michael Jackson = King of pop
Madonna = Queen of pop
Justin Timberlake = Prince of pop
Britney Spears = Princess of pop"
you're totally right.
forever fan♥
Which MJ..aka King of Pop was complete opposite.
"I love JT's music, but you can't call someone the ""Prince of Pop"" if he isn't fully a pop singer lol. He is R&B 90% of his music y'all."
I LOVE Justin s2
"Justin's time to appeal largely to the 11-18 year olds has come and gone. Much as his music has matured, his fanbase is a little bit older, a little bit wiser, and largely employed full-time, not surfing YouTube all day like Bieber's little girl fanbase.

I'd rather have 200,000 hits from real fans who like real music than 200 million hits from a bunch of dribbling little girls who don't know their ass from their elbow."
Amazing JT
Dissapointed..
"Sounds good, its like his old stuff"
"this song cold yo JT 20/20 Gonna go harder then the first one .. come check my music out when you get a chance help keep real underground hip hop music going latest track up called ""Keep The Dreams Goin"""
Whoop! Love This! Love Timbaland's Productions! Can't Wait for 2 of 2! <3
"great job jt¡¡¡¡
the 20/20 experience 2 of 2 will be a hit¡¡¡
 i cant wait more ....go go go more views¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡"
All his new songs sound alike. I can't be the only one to think this
"I've been a fan of this man since i was 12 years old, an i have to say he only gets better! , This song is probably one of the best i've heard off both albums so far! I could totally see myself dancing to this song every time i hear it, even tho I'm 6 months pregnant!  :)"
but tbh the views don't really matter
"I have to say i agree with Chris V, Justin is so much better than Bruno Mars."
"No, because we want Work Bitch to be no # 1."
lixo
He is because he is good [Period]
Upravo tako nesto htedoh da napisem.
ty like seriously I only care about Justin Timberlake right now...ppl always wanna talk about someone else on somebody's video 
"Hahahaha može, tako što teramo ove što imaju da kupuju :D"
It's a shame to speak about bieber shit  while I'm hearing Justin Timberlake 
"did Timberland say ""She kill me with that coo coo coochie coo""?! LMBO"
"In comparing JT to new pop you have to be careful. He is ""New Pop"" he just happened to get his start at the end of the MJ/Janet era pop style. Which is why JT vocals are so lush and his melodies and harmonies are tight. Listen to pop from the late 80's and 90's and you'll hear that same caliber of vocals. "
timberland beat
Brasil love you justin <33
Maybe they are friends and its not him on JT albums but them working together. DUH
Prince of Pop <3
The fact that you even compare JT to those other two artist is appalling and RETARDED. JT was famous a DECADE before those other artist.
103 people are knocked out by Justin.
This album is going to be so god damn mother fucking money
"Justin doesn't mind Tim to be in every song, it's his album after all, what's up to you?"
I LOVEEEEEED
"Nice laid back mello sound & style so, yes I could ride with this song...."
"JT is the man, his haters are jealous"
Awsum beat nd JT's voice make it perfect ....
elmo songs
can't wait the video 
"weak, man. real lame

Amazing <333

TKO is #6 on iTunes now. Can we make it #1?
Now I know what JT only works with Timbaland..
"Every JT I hear for the first time, I will like it.. Thats why he is a genius."
JT never disappoint me. Amazing song. Keep going Justin <3
This song knocks the fuck out of bieber and one direction TKO OOH !!!!
EPICNESS!!!
It's wonderful
"That's ok. Maybe because you only like teen songs, go back to bieber, and when you grow up, you'll like the real class music of the original Justin, the Timberlake."
;D
Indeed 
Tim Team!
"Can’t fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can’t fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?"
Oh I love this comment haha yeah! :P
Probably some Taylor Swift or some trash like that 
Gotta love TIM.. he does his thing every time..
lame ur face!
"if this was a bieber song, it would have a million hits over night. just shows how much people like shit music these days. smh"
I don't even wanna know what you consider to be NOT 'shit' -_-

"Me too damn I'm counting down the days I have Justified,FutureSex/LoveSounds and The 20/20 Experience Volume 1 "
"OMG have fun when you go!!! :D
And I agree with you!"
Timbaland's beats sound the same that's laughable what kind of bullshit is that. People must only listen to the stuff he's produced for J.T. and not other people 
"Pharrell  Timothy.

Jus' sayin'."
I do! :D
And great chemistry too 
"Yes, it is always normal :)"
WHO ALSO LOVES THIS DIFFERENT SOUND OF HIS SONGS? 
The same beats from Tim????? CTFU you can't be serious?????
You have no taste
well...I think they're all outrageous and perfect. sound different than this random radio sh*t
She killed me with that Coochy kooooooo
is it normal that this goes so fast? :o
Amazing ♥
Yea I'm tired of timberland's beats too!! Bring back the Neptunes please!!
"This song is in Nr 7 on iTunes top 10 USA now, let's make this song to nr 1 :)"
Agreed! ;D
Every song from him actually has the same beat !! Such a boring JT! Maybe Timberland has to be fired...sorry but this is my opinion !!
Timberlake Killed Others :P
Agreed! :D <3
"I am laughing way too hard at this haha I do hear it!

Ahh well it is a new song!! :D That in itself makes me happy!"
Yasssssssssssss!
JT Prince of pop.

Fukin trolls.. This songs fire!!!

Perfect ❤❤
OMG ❤❤❤
The king is back 
He kinda looks like Robin Thicke here..
I am addicted to this song
"Fuck, I can't unhear that now. "
From part 1 on 20/20 to Jiggas album and back with part 2. Timbaland #greatest
Beautiful!!!
"Timbaland NEEDS to win Producer of the Year. Holy shit,"
The President of Pop !
AMEN to EVERYTHING you said!!!
He always brings it! Been a fan since I was 9!

Love it ! JT is the best <3
Love it
Love 3

Once the king dies a new king must be crowned. JT is just the Current king imo.
"Total Knock Out.. its a fighting term

Sounds like classic Timbaland!!!
Total Knock Out.

Congrats JT *-*"
aaaand what does it mean T.K.O? :3
Man! He never disappoints me! Great music from JT ever since he went solo. Love him and his music to death!!!!!
"yea that was crazy, that sound is still in my head, i can recall it in a flash, thats how unique it was..hes forward thinking kinda guy..im sure we'll have some tasty treats coming to us from his lab"
AWESOME
Muito Boa!!
JT INSPIRATION ♥♥ ALWAYS AWESOME :)
JT INSPIRATION ♥♥ ALWAYS AWESOME :)
"OMG. He still run this, bitches !"
"OMG. He still run this, bitches !"
JT INSPIRATION ♥♥ ALWAYS AWESOME :)
about britney?! amazing song nonetheless
"Thank you, JT!"
Justin never disappoints and should basically never stop making music.. 
AWESOME!!
Maquina de hits.
amazing I love it <3
"I love you Justin, I wanna marry you!!"
Awesome!
#youneverknow
Shit is dope! Anybody that says different has horrible taste in music/sound. Just sayin...
I personaly don't like this song. Still looking forward to the album !
How can you be so perfect JT? your songs are always awesome!!!!
I'm so sorry JT but it sucks
"Jimmy Fallon introduced him as the ""president of pop"" "
"this song looks like ones of his first albums, i like that sooooo much his voice is sweet as always and the beat killing it. thank you JT for these perfect 7 minutes"
"It will be a great album.. 
True story"
Its growin on me..prefer last couple minutes... JT is more of a mid tempo guy... this ones little too uptempo for me... still can't beat some new JT..yesss!!
"Monarchy is gone when MJ died so now we have a Republic of Pop, and the President is JT !"
its rnb music ...
"yeah? Didn't know, but that's interesting ;)"
Sorry but this is going to be a big Flop !!!
T-T-T-TKO
remember when he kinda shocked us with his rocky sound in Sexy Back ? with his distorted voice and stuff
zzZZz
This video will be to official
it is timbo
Are you stupid? Timberland is one of the greatest producers of all time. Justin Timberlake is an amazing singer but without the amazing production skills behind his songs they wouldn't be as great. 
"His voice sounds really incredible, like in all his songs but he is getting better and better"
hahaha I didn't realize of the Guinea pig's second voice until I readed your comment
YAYYY
"TKO..Jt is always unique in interlude.. Timberlake+ Timboo \m/..
"
LOVE IT!
This song is hot I can't wait to get the second part of the 20/20 experience
I like how it sounds like there are Guinea pigs squealing in the song
I don't care anymore
The one and only<3<3<3 
Timbaland has his hands all over it....we need more JT
Completely amazing
"wow, this is absolutely perfect"
the 2nd half >>>>
Love him *O* ♥♥♥♥♥♥!

I like it - sounds like Timbo on the production
what a song
"pesma KIDA....respect
"
this is fuc**ng awesome!!!
But that's obviously Prince.
Timberlake Knockout
"But that doesn't make sense, MJ is the King, then JT should be The Prince of pop."
Did you know that's why he decided to name his album the 20/20 Experience?
He's so talent
Maravilhoso!
That's why Radio version exists. 
JT killed it on this one (y) 
He is so talented
"Jt and timbaland are a dangerous duo,great track..no question justin will impress us again on this album...but will he SHOCK us??..thats what im waiting for lol...just something so outside of the box..maybe a track where part of it is recorded with a folk band out of hungary...I dunno just something crazy lol..come on justin..F*CK WITH US!!!! :)"
"He's the Frank Sinatra of our generation. Singer, dancer, actor, and one hell of a performer."
My High School girlfriend loved him and it was really the only thing she listened to that I could tolerate. Then I found myself listening to it by myself. Now I'm addicted.
Love him.. Love his music.. Flawless <3 ;)
Technical Knockout.... T.K.O
"PERFEEEEEEECT SONG.

Give me a chance you won't regret it
If u feel like subscribing that'd be awesome and it'd mean the world to me.
THANK YOU SO MUCH"
these are Timbalands songs featuring JT lol  i felt like the song didnt get GREAT until like 4:50 
JT should make shorter singles because it will make the higher position for the singles in the charts 'cause people are very busy :)! 
If you Gonna Pass the CROWN of KING OF POP it would Def. JT.
what does TKO mean ?
"I wouldn't say he's the ""king"" but he's most def the president or prince of pop. He's super talented & I think MJ would be proud."
Incrível como TODAS as músicas são fantásticas !
Great
Stop comparing them ! They are both amazing and unique ! Besides he awarded as the best pop singer AFTER Michael Jackson
OMG AMAZING!!!!!!!
Sempre otimas musicas
He's been named the 'President of Pop'
Nope. 
TKO on bosnian language it means WHO ;)
Love the beat! It just shows that he can make different kinds of music from take back the night too tko. Love JT and his music.
Foda!
I think it's definitely safe to say Mj the king of pop Jt prince of pop most definitely
Pq musicas tão grandes??? Porém amei 3
Arrasou *-*

Michael will always be the king of pop. But Justin is the best nowadays ...

Everything he does... perfection! lol
"This song is so dope, Timbaland gets a bit annoying at times but still this is really good."
"Adore this song, can't wait for the album ♡♥♡♥♡♥"

"Why would he release a single that comes from the first part of the album, when the second part of the album is released 10 days from now. He has to promote the second album now, you know."
"Reminds me of Usher in some parts of the song and ""Tunnel Vision"". Other than that, this song is crazy good!"

"AMEI AMEI A MUSICA JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE VC REALMENTE É O PRINCE OF POP *-*
"
"but it is a great beat, timbo is genius one of the best music producer"
he should have released this first! instead of take back the night. this song screams badass!!! 
"I thought timbo do for JT something new disco style as ""Take Back the Night"""
Technical knock out...
"goose bumps from beginning to end, so good"
So perfect
on some cookie cutter shit
Timberlake + Timbaland = Perfection
"Finally, second single!! :D Brilliant track JT! :)"
Justin being just... Justin. Loved it!
And who the hell you think that produce to JT !?

Why does it matter if his songs are slightly longer now? They are amazing the entire 7-8 mins and worth listening to. -_- 
Oh Yes Honey! I Love It!
True artist! Keeps learning and adapting. I'm amazed.
I love it but I feel stupid for not knowing what TKO means!!
"jt...no one delivers melodies like him....and as far as the beat....timbo is god.....that 2nd part....MY LORD, i think i skipped every heart beat in that 2 mins"
"Why must his new era have all these 8 minute songs?, do an all radio edit version of LP!"
Ready for the album now!!!! love this!

Damn you got it JT
"LOVE THIS

"Trying go below the belt, through my chest, perfect right into the dome... Woo love that part! 11 more days guys!"

"i could live without the ""coochi coo"". but i love the song. "
Sampling a squeaking guinea pig? Seems legit.
Pharrell?
"Timbo already did this beat :
Short Dawg - You Know I'm Fresh feat. Bun B and !!!!!!"
The true Justin..and prince of POP :')
"another tired Timbaland beat
"
JT does it again! Love it!

Timbo x JT coochie coo xD
“She killed me with that coochie coo”? hahahah
"Don't know bout this one. Product of 20 days in the studio, you can tell with this song. Part one is the business, but don't know bout part two. He should of changed producers for part two."

I am raping the replay button. Dope beat. More of these songs please.
nothing special...just another dated Timbaland production
"""All of the whistle blows"" ? That's grammatically incorrect."
"another heater, keep them coming JT."
"No whistles in boxing, hoss."
Better than Take Back the Night... Could do without the ending on this one.
"hey yall know this song is too long  and it sounds old too 
"
I think this has #1 potential.
Damnnnnnn !!!!!!!! This is great

YAAAAAAAAAS! JT & TIMBALAND DUN DID IT AGAAAAAAAINNNNN
"That award was for his videos though, so he had to keep the focus on that. That's why he thanked all the video directors. JT wil give Tim his credit at the Grammys. Remember that JT asked Tim to follow him up to the podium and accept awards at 2007 VMA's."
I WANT THE DANCE VIDEO TO THIS SONG! <3

"Hello- For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Jesus loves you.💕 Being a Christian is to also follow God commandments with love, to stay loyal to him no matter what. It’s to be humble and know that we are sinners, but God loves us and through his death on the cross we can have eternal life if we accept him. It is to sacrifice our own desires for God’s wish. Wake up everyday and choose to do our best and help the one around us. Love people, share the gospel and live with truth in our hearts. As Christian we are not made to be like everyone and not everyone will like us, but God is always there and we can find comfort in his words."
Love this. ❤️❤️❤️

Te amo flaco ❤️❤️❤️ me criaron con tus canciones y jamas voy a olvidarte ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Nice track with a great meaning in its lyrics. There are better days ahead for the hard worker, and grafter that focuses on change. Spirituality encourages us to seek after better days. The bad times we face in this life should motivate us to work towards change, instead of bring us down."
This didnt age well. Dope song but fuck me wheres the better days
Let's go Brandon

Such a nice performance for an elderly man with dementia who can’t remember how to tie his shoes let alone lead a country and an incompetent vice politician to boot.

"Darn, you lost me as a fan Justin."
"high gas prices, inflation and broken promises - you keep your student debt, BLM your on your own, no increase to min wage etc. Bette days? no more bad tweets that's it! wasn't worth it"
"an actual racist who once referred to Obama as clean, did a eulogy at Robert Birds Funeral, a once high ranking kkk member, said if you don't vote for him you ain't black and oh yeah on CNN, black people don't have ID or the internet. Remove one for one with an even worse history of racism. Stupid people everywhere."
Diferenciado
Beautiful days are coming!❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹💙💙🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈💕🌈💙💯💯💯 you don’t even know. GOD is sooooo perfect and beautiful! Life is amazing.
Justin always uses black artist then turns on them. Trash

"All you are garbage, first justin homosexual"
"👈🏿👈🏾👈🏽👈🏼
My black community of austra ancient oceania. Can never be replace by another black community. Not after what another black community did to my fair skin community the living ones. The ones that are alive."
👈🏿👈🏿👈🏽👈🏽 my dark skinned maori community. Not african can never replace my ancestors never. If they were here in colour I would tell them what other black communities did to my people of colour. & tried to harm them in white colour. That's what I would say to my ancestors?. It's only been 6 generations ago. 5 generations ago. Since the last black community of maori. To the brown community.

"Justin Timberlake actions: Janet Jackson at the Super bowl (Ripped her outfit, let one of her boobs be exposed, stood there... did nothing... but of course at that time it was always the women's fault, so his fame, money grows and grows...) and Britney Spears Cry me a river music video (Claims she cheated, of course at the times women gets blamed, his fame grows and grows...still to this day) But you know ""forgive but don't forget"""

"Justin Timberlake
If it's our fate to go it's our fate to go then. What ever happens next?. What would become of us?. The Antarctica is melting and if the land sinks we all sink with it. I am sinking with my ship. With my precious countries."
"Justin Timberlake
Then China started threatening us. And I was like why are they doing that?.

Because the Mongolians migrated into Alaska all the way to south America. They are going to use that to take over our oceania region.

Because the natives are asian. From the asian continent. They don't know that?."
"Justin Timberlake
I knew that my people were from America, Alaska, green land, Canada ages ago. I wasn't sure but. It was in my heart. 

Because of genghis khan warfare against the Persian empire. Then becoming friends with the Turks of persia. And bringing them to Siberia to introduce them to his people. And then Genghis Khan had a lot of children.

Now the Mongolians done a huge favour. They just made it whole. When they said Mongolian went into Alaska. Because I didn't know that question."
♥️
I'm so in love with this song. But really angry that they (Biden) used this song. But also to expected. He's evil and preciously the opposite
My favorite singer
"If this is what you want in my region?. We are trying to get my region healthier.

Pussified.
"You guys should check out the guy who was mistaken for a suicide bomber on this day right outside the building, just because he was wearing a cloth.
Here is the link https://youtu.be/24FK6UkgwQo"
That song should be elected as anthem for BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION GOD BLESS AMERICA
"Love this song. And makes me love my people even harder cause its our music, talents, and such that heal this world. They cant kill our soul!!!!!!!!"
This song should be nominated by every awards in the world whether if it’s applicable or not.
"Hello friend from America))) As always, you are cool and I am another listener of your masterpieces, I would like to know how you feel .... Ukrainian desire to listen to you and see you))) Your right to look at our country as Africa has the right, We not better, but 200% not worse. my message will be lost among everyone.
I wish you health and thanks for the Tweet))"
If this didn't move you in some type of positive way you are not human
This brought tears to my eyes I love it
"When I first listened to this song when it came on live, I felt they were singing a song about dealing with the pandemic as a whole community.   So many songs highlight feelings during the Vietnam War, and I felt this was the first song that was written to elevate and motivate people to “keep moving forward.”     That was my take.   I really love it."
I am praying for better days.
This is the best and you have done Bc I’m going through a lot of things and what you are sing is happening to me

เป็นร้อยเป็นพัน
แต่เมื่อฉัน เหงาเมื่อไหร่
ในใจฉันมีแค่เพียงเธอ"
"they all want to make music for you. Don't let that happen. You are the Star and you are to shine, not them. You can't hide yourself from anyone. Do not do this. Do your thing;) as you have done so far. I love you old without any subtext. I just wish that I could always identify with you, and the direction that seems right for you is a one-way path. You have a beautiful life and millions of fans. Do not let them down and I ask only for this. greetings"
Yes LORD! Better days are coming.
You guys killed it. Thank you!
Wow Ant Clemens I love your voice..I could listen to you all day long
Better days for the entire world!
Justin I've been listening to you lately I dedicated mirrors to my teenage daughter and now this both of you are incredibly talented I needed this. Love you
"Amazing performance as always. This song brings hope to many people in America, and all over the world, as we look forward to better days!"

Fantastic song😘
"There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feelin' lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It gets worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead

Better days are coming
Better days are coming
Better days, better days
Better days are coming

Mmm 
I know you been kicked down
Slept on
Let down
Faith gone
Waited for too long 
For something
To lean on
You feel weak
Just be strong
Deep breath,
Stay calm
And if you just press on
Press on, press on

You gone see there's a light at the end of the tunnel 
Keep your eyes on the road ahead 
But if you're feeling lost in the night 
It's okay to cry 
Just as long as you hold your head

Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
[Better days]
It gets worse before it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead

Better days are coming [I know, know]
Better days are coming {I know, I know}
Better days, better days
Better days are coming

{Better days, better days} [I know, I know]

I know you’ve feel left out and stepped on
Keep going, keep going
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep going higher, and higher and higher and higher

(It gets, it gets, it gets)
Better days, better days are coming
(Better days)
Better days, better days (On their way) are coming ('Cause I know)
Better days, better days (Better days) are coming (Yeah)
Better days, better days are coming

I know [people get better]
Better , better 
Cause I know [people get better]
better, better yeah

If you can see it, believe it
Things will get better 
People will get better, better
Wow (people will get better) 
If you can see it, believe it
Wow
I know the things will get better [better]

Better [better] better together [better]
I know better [better] better [better]
I know the better days ahead
Better days are coming"
"Who will still remember after 10 years,that this was a better days..👏✊🏿💪"
"So much better with gospel touch! Thank you, JT mah man!! ❤️😇🙌"
Onerepublic-Better Days
It’s a shame that such a great song with a unifying message has to be used in a politically divisive way. God is the light at the end of the tunnel! Not Biden and Harris.
"They all sound great together. Better days are coming, yes Lord! I do believe."
Ant Clemons has an AMAZING voice!  WOW!!!!  Great harmony!
"Yes, sing it!! This is soo fitting 😭🙌"
Marvin Gaye?
The better days will come only when people become better. Let's hope songs like this will achieve to make some changes in our confused mind and hearts!
"Healing to the great USA!
No hate only faith and God!"
Can I get an Amen?
"The cheaters are back in office. I swear I will not buy or rent any video's, movies or music until these corrupt people are out of the white house!"

"Such a beautiful performance, made me cry..and i'm only 13! lol lets hope and pray 2021 will be nicer to us, better days are coming guys keep your head held high! <3"
"What a beautiful inspirational song. My god, what a horrible time for our country; pain, suffering, despair, death, sickness all around, insane madman insurrecting civil violence and death, talking crazy about his fake numbers . President Biden is our better, our better days. God bless him and his beautiful brilliant wife...working day by day (not golfing or  holding insane covid spreader rallies) to lead us thru this. What a shameful time we've lived thru."
"When Biden and Harris take this country down, let's see if your still dancing then . Singed the pre born babies."
Great. It feels so good and I love the feelings. Yes let us pray for better days. It's being too long.
Ditto
Currently crying rn brb

"Felt that, guys!"

"Interesting how he is supposedly the most loved president in history yet there were hardly any people at rallies, barely any people at his inauguration... barely any views at all for social media... liar, pervert, thief, waste of tax payer dollars... those words can be used in several different descriptive sentences"
It is super cool - Kudos from Brazil
"Ok now....Ant Clemmons!!!!

I like this song a lot! Good job everyone."
Is the first guy singing Melanie Safka's song? The lyrics sound like one of her songs or a copy.

Things will get better Now with a strong Leader President Biden's Auguration
"'What sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.' - Isaiah 5:20

Repent and turn to Christ! We are told that the End Times will be dark indeed and we are all born as sinners. Joe Biden supports abortion and Kamilla Harris wants to tear down the American Constitution and says its outdated. (America was founded on God) Jesus mentioned events of what would happen in the End Times..

Matthew  24 1-'Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.'

The chapter of the bible in Revelation mentions the seven seals which include terrible events to come to those who have not repented. There will be something called a rapture where people will suddenly disappear from the earth and those are the Christians. What is left here will be events of the coming of an Antichrist up until receiving the mark of the beast (Satan) It condemns you straight to hell and the only other option is to die and only be a servant of God instead of inherit eternal life.

John 14:16- Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.


Turn to Jesus now because we are all born as sinners. No man or President will be able to save you from what is to come. Only Christ was pure and if you want to be set free from what is to come and not be condemned to hell you need to accept Christ soon- Time is running out..

"Used to love him...  but now he is just a douche bag.   Wealthy *shocker*....  so what.  He is wealthy douche bag.    These days are not any better, unless you condone this crappy treatment of the national guard for example."
"Great song, should of sang it when Trump pass the first step act, or the funding of Black Colleges. Or when the vaccine came out within a year. Or when Obama was president for 8yrs and nothing happened."

Justin Timberlake this along with other things has made me reject you I have watched you from The Mickey Mouse Club until now your views are scared and you're drinking the media's Kool-Aid. Hopefully someday you'll return home to your true Roots because this is a sickening depiction of what you could have been
my favorite artist
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥
<3
Memphis rep your zip... 38103 here!
Loved loved loved this song. It is so uplifting and gives hope of better days.❤️❤️❤️
Hearing this song was like spring after a long dark winter. It lights a spark of hope in a time when it seem so hopeless. Better is ahead!
These two guys together are phenomenal!  One of my favorite performances of the Inaugural celebration!
"Thank you for this amazing song well needed,  we sure need better days!! 👍🙏"

The work they must have put in to this. wow this is just amazing. I love this song . best 2021 song
Amazing!!! 🤩👏👏👏
Justin i love your work but this obssesion with biden drives me crazy.. You were scared of Trump because he wanted transparency in your field of music and hollywood as well.. You artists didnt want this of course thats why you voted with 2 hands
So many songs of unity and acceptance during the Biden Inauguration you got to love it.
I love the collab! Justin's vocals have gotten so much better as he has aged. This song is fantastic!
😍💝
Didn't expect anything else from a sellout who sold its soul to the devils contract
This feels so good🥰
What a great opportunity and performance.
wish the USA all the best whether that will work with Biden is more than questionable.
"SENSAÇÃO DO MOMENTO, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, SÓ PANCADA DE SUCESSO, COMO  SEMPRE.
 ;-)"
Ant Clemons has an anointed voice. And it was legit my dream to hear Justin Sing some gospel while I’m living.
Thank you very much for great performance.

Good job man!!!!
So I’ve been a Justin fan for a very long time (his new voice in politics is SUPER annoying!) but man Ant Clemons is hot!!  Some of us been listening to him since he did so many features on Kanye’s unreleased album.  Soooo Love Ant Clemons!!!!  Don’t sleep on him!
lt's beautiful!👏👏❤
It is so goood🥰🥰 Love you from Georgia-Sakartvelo❤🇬🇪

"WOW... That was pretty frickin amazing...   Unbelievable the amount of talent from everyone in this ensemble... Finally tuned voices of these two men, and every piece of this was so well orchestrated. From dance moves, film angles, style they wore and their voices - all incredible.  

It did bring tears because it also brought hope, If there's one thing that's going to unify this country, it's the heart centered people singing like this... Something about music that just takes everything to a better place."
My Idol! Very prod of you! 🇧🇷❤
"WOW, What a voices Ant Clemens has... And of course we love Justin"

"Definitely one of the highlights. The whole show was fantastic. Including the commercial ""breaks"".  I wish they had added the Killers with Brandon doing  his song ""Only the Young"".  The lyrics seem to reflect what's been happening recently.   They are such a great American band. Should be at these iconic events,  including the Superbowl half-time show."

"JT: music means more to me than anybody in the world

Wao I admire  you
Justin is a great artist.
LMAO
Little did we know what was coming! The 20/20 experience is an all time classic. I only hope Timba & JT do another of these collabs because they are TIMELESS!
Who randomly got this in their recommended?
Click bait SMH
And NOW he's back y'all ...!!!
I SURE AM! 💯
I love very nice music
"Yes, I think that we have to put our best quality in what we do, as things go far and last long. Though the standards of what we do tend to want to get better and better, characteristic that feels good as life should get improving when we want to go into the improving direction. I cannot show only the perfected versions of my work or process but I keep working on my progress and knowledge and emotional development so quality can become natural in most of the things I am and do and show at any given time with people to prove it or alone or without people. EK"
Are you ready again JT?
2019 Anyone?
no tenias una camisa mas arrugada?
💚💚💚💚💚😘
I'm ready
"Simple. Sublime. Music for the Century. Say Something ft. Chris Stapleton (Official Video). Profound.

Carried me to make my life right. Thank you Justin. Stay with Love and your music will find the next profound template."
Hi looks awesome😎❤💚💜💙💛😘😍💋💘💕
WOW life is too short you have a beautiful family now it will all come together when it's ready there's no rush for you to get these albums
5 years later now He’s about to drop the best album so far in a week. Way to go JT  💪#2018.
melhor artista  do mundo
Iconic
go watch him  perform like i love you live paris.
He needs to do a new version of this video ASAP!
These are my questions now JT! Make more music please!!!
"I'm sorry to say that Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have divorce!!!! they do have a son together, and I'm sure they will be cordial with one another!!!!!! but his true love ls with Britney  and they're back together and that's all I have to say."
come back and save music again king. show them basic boys how it's done!
When is that new *NSYNC record coming out?
No she's not (BRITNEY IS BETTER FOR HIM)❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕
He actually made 4 albums in one decade.
2 years ago today... Damn time flies! #ThankYouJT for The 20/20 Experience for everything! You're the best ever for me ❤
"Justin get back with Britney Spears you are meant to be. 
"
"You ready, JT?"
I thought it was the song poop ha ha LOL
Gato
wat
FETT !!
"1 year ago <3
Dopo 7 anni di attesa, praticamente tutta la mia adolescenza, a questa notizia ero scoppiata in lacrime :') E' stato un anno fantastico! Thank you JT <3"
I couldn't agree with u more....art takes time.amen.and is only worth expressing when it's ripe and ready.
The shortest JT video ever
Search for J Pee - I'm Ready for an excellent parody ;)
He´s not ready. He´s gonna be Justin TimberLATE. 
If you listen to some of his old albums you can hear that he makes a solid 50% of the beats with his mouth. Don't think he hired someone to move his mouth for him.
Long a wait disappointment
"Oh yeah,now Justin is back!! ♥"
Nobody cares what you think. Julez is right.
Mad love <3
legend <3
perfection takes time
I too :* <3
to me tupac is overrated... as the best ever he isnt there alone at the top...
thats why I just LOVE you !
IF TUPAC WERE ALIVE JT AND TUPAC GOTTA DO A SONG TOGETHER WHOS WITH MEH? THUMBS UP
I listen to this 10 times a day
"Has anyone seen the barely political version of this, it's hilarious"
His voice❤❤❤
"Come and check out my Autism vlog, Autism Speaks Out!"
Long awaited finically here and couldn't have came at a better time. 2013 the year that will be mark down in music history for JT becoming one of the Greats
Great song.
thank god for this day
Tidus?
"You're kind of stupid. Justin produces a lot himself as well. Even in this album, he co-writes and co-produces every song on it. Watch the details and then shut up."
Gettin' my JT fix. It has been awhile.
"I thought the album was gonna be better through this video, but it didnt gave me chills as the other ones"
oh youtube…whenever i need a laugh you provide a stupid video and even dumber comments.
It's a nice thing to see.
everything he sayin is a lie he just saying all of that so people buy his by making them think he cares about his music and his fans it called manipulation.
"the 20/20 experience is nothing but throw garbage most of his fans will just think anything he does is a true classic all these songs will be forgotten 10 years from now
"
"0:08
""it means...more to me than ANYBODY else in the world"" 
Jessica Biel: whut. well fuck u too"
It's funny to watch this now. And there'd a cd and More to come
big up
I could listen to him sing the phone book all day... Love him and his voice
Please come in Calgary Alberta too.
You may of been ready JT but the world wasn't ready..... This is why they will never understand the effort and determination you put into your music....
Like u
"Marleelee G couldn't have said it any better; Justin Timberlake is a timeless classic!  I am 53-years-old and love his talent.  In fact, I am going to his concert in south Florida with my daughter in August and my boss's late father who just passed was in his 80's and loved Justin's music.  He not only appeals to the younger crowd, he has rich talent that appeals to many generations.
"
"So true. JT is the best. 
"
"yea i totally get that...i really cant choose...the guy's legend :D
"
Hammer
Im thinkin a sung fixin to start and then it ends at IM READY Wtf? ! ? Disappointed.
well said
Watch free music
"suck bad, you mean suck balls"
Nice video
"i loved mirror, pleas respond







"
"Tupac was poor but he's the greatest rapper ever...His parents did shit all for him.
Justin Timberlake writes his songs.. He is great on piano and guitar, he sings live while he does great dance moves.. He is very very talented and gifted."
Это просто самая крутая песня!
Responding to the question i want a collabo with Britney Spears :D 
"there's this thing for people who say they 'never had the chance' its called the X Factor or even American Idol - if you're not there don't blame your parents for not paying for you, you're alive so they obviously fed & clothed you

blame yourself as you're either not hungry enough to be trying that extra inch or not talented enough - hell Beiber was found on here so there's really no excuse to say you ""didn't have the in's"" when you've been on here for  5 1/2 years and uploaded only 2 songs"
thanks lol
I couldn't have said it any better (Y)
"""Sexy"" is ""back""!
yeyyy!
Do it with someone, we do not expect..
Maybe your total opposite in music, voice and style?
yeaaah :D"
Gotta love Mayer Hawthorne's take showin' some love to JT.  Search Mayer Hawthorne - I'm Ready
To all the haters: he did it again.
Love it.
"you do know that Usher, Ney-Yo and Bruno Mars are R& B artist not Pop, JT is a popstar so he's in MJ line and he's the best male Pop artist, hell he's the only one beside Justin Bieber and you can't even compare the two"
"Writing your own music is not an achievement when your lyrics are as cringe-worthy as Mr. Timberlake's. Usher is a far more talented singer and dancer. The same with Neyo. Bruno just has a better voice. Either way, all 3 surpass Timberlake in at least one form or another. Hence why it is problematic labeling him the prince of pop. I won't even dwell on how insulting it is comparing a legend like MJ to Timberlake. But that is your opinion and you are free to have it."
"Like Michael, Justin was in a group and then became a solo artist and was successful like MJ. Usher doesn't write his own shit, Bruno is new and Ne-yo is a better song-writer than a performer. There is a reason JT solo career did better than JC from Nsync who sings better than him... and there for he is the Prince of Pop"
JT come visit us in Australia!! :D
"I wouldn't even call him the prince. There are many other male artists who are far more talented and more deserving of that title as far as I'm concerned. Usher, Neyo and even Bruno Mars spring to mind."
LOL! Wow. Can you say self-aggrandizing? Definitely a legend in his own mind.
"<3 LOVE <3
"
"It's so true what Justin's saying he puts so much love in his art. His music is incredible becuz you can feel the love. Very Michael Jaksonesque lol. This album, The 20/20 Experience has so many hits on it....i can't even pic a favorite song, that's how good it is! Justin just keeps getting better. This is his best album to date. JT's in his own league, you can't compare him to anyone. Can't say enuff good things about this album.....it's timeless a true classic Lol"
LOVE me some JT...soooo glad he's back!!
The new album is available for streaming on iTunes. And it's incredible.
The key of awesome version of this is hilarious :P
thefinebros sent you here?
"The difference between you and him is that you couldn't be famous.  Go watch your videos...They suck bad

"I actually dont like any of those people you listed...I dont listen to rap music....sooooooooo youre incorrect. Like I said...The ppl you listen to i could care less about they are not legends in my eyes, or ears.  "

go squeal at your fav boo. 
Put down your crack pipe
LOL !!!!
"Spoken like a purely partisan, JT fanatic"
"Ok I get that you don't like the guy but think about him as a human being for a second. Maybe he felt like taking a break for a while and doing other things he enjoys, like acting and spending time with his new wife. He has the right to do that. And he doesn't imitate other people, he draws inspiration from them. There's nothing wrong with that. At least he's different that the crap artists that are out right now. Now go watch a video of someone you actually like and stop wasting your time. "
Don't you mean shut up and let him keep imitating others.
I'm really glad some one else seen it. It means more to you but you walk away while everyone else continues making music throughout the 2000s til now. But it means ore to him than anybody. Just wow. People are really kissing his ass again too. Out of nowhere. Why would the Grammy's reward someone who has not supported music for 7 long years. He copies everyone also.
That was lame. What a pretentious asshole. Moving on...
yessss talk in my ear baby! lol

"You people need to stop complaining. He's coming out with NEW stuff and NEW sounds. At least he's bringing something different to music than the shit artists are doing right now. I personally love Suit and Tie. I can't stop listening to it. Yes, it is different but that's a good thing!  Just like Sexyback was different and looked how that turned out! So shut up and let JT do his thing. There's a whole album to look forward to!"
Then he made Suit and Tie...ugh.
His shirt needs ironed... Badly.
Your new song sucks.

@TheEmi5505
1:00 best part
I feel Justin has had his Off the Wall and Thriller albums..and its downhill from there. Although I am rooting for him to put some good shit out cause we need it. Music in general needs it.!
KOCHAM!!!
and what is so wrong with trying to keep the money coming? 
justin timberlake is so annoying with his high pitched voice. he is only making another album to keep the money coming. 
YAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!! My Brother's Gonna Flip Out

to just listen and give me some
feedback on what you think/thought of my voice etc!!
i really just want someone to hear 
me out because music means so much to me! just some feedback and time is all i ask for. so far so good."

It seems you love to be here:) how pathetic
your ignorance is bigger than your whole body girl xd
"is there even a video yet or what?
"
This clip makes me look forward to his album...at least.  I will agree that some music artists do overdue it by trying to push out material year end and year out.  You can burn out that way and lose the drive to make music.  Take your time JT.
JT IS BACK!!! YEAH!!
"you are such a dumbasses knowing nothing about movies and actors, so you should all just shut up cause if Justin wouldn't be good as an actor, no one would ask him to play in a movie and he wouldn't have such a success he had with ""Friends with Benefits"", ""Bad Teacher"" and so many... and by the way, he started acting (for real movies) since 2001 so you all just go stfu!"
"Your album has to be good now after this kind of set up lol! Btw, your 2007 album was pretty dayum good for the time."
Who gives a shit? Arrogant ass.
Plz come back~ I've been waiting for too damn long~~~
Justin... just admit it.. you failed miserably as an actor so your going back to singing.... pretentious by the way
finally the next king of pop is back
About time! :)
Thumbs up if barleypolitical brought you here
And the point of that video was.......?
"wow Justin you sure think highly of your self.... that is a very pretensions this to say... i would rather watch you crappy acting on TV then listen to your new album which i such will be cleverly titled ""I'm Ready"""

You think his first single wouldn't be mediocre after watching this...but it is.
"but is it really you?

yes.... theres much better music there.
You'll probably never read this..or care to...but how was working with Mila Kunis?

"Justin would you ever consider doing a cover of queens bohemian rhapsody? I think you would do a good job if you did.plus I have a 100.00 bet on whether you reply back to this message.my friend said you wouldn't,and if you don't I have to give her a 100 bucks... so can you help me get some payback?"
I remember seeing him in concert (front row I might add) like 12 years ago-- still <3 him!
Who cares about another Timberlake album? When is 'N SYNC getting back together?
"okay well everyone has a different taste in music your ""good"" music can be music I dont care about...not everyone listens to Johnny Cash, Oasis, effin Queen and more. I know I dont! People are going to come out with new music...cause I think most the ppl you listed are not really breathing, so they cant really make new hits...soooo shush"
I'm ready too Justin! Shit I'VE BEEN READY!
Great !

He should iron out his shirt before saying he's ready
"I'm waiting for the moment that I would type ""Justin"" and get Timberlake again, not bieber shit"
"Very good point. We need more musicians like Justin who think and care about what they are writing rather than some of the talentless bull that's on the radio these days. Bullshit like Lil'Wayne and Young Money Records.. there is no heart in hip hop anymore. I feel like the only decent pop-stars are Eminem, B.o.B, MGK, and Katy Perry"

And so it began..after years of contemplation Justin Timberlake had come to the conclusion to return to his noble quest to become black...
"The world enjoys worshipping false idols. The proof is music, very few hits songs are really that exceptional. People that are not seen make as good if not better songs. But, in the need for acceptance, mostly seen throgh teenagers people love a false idol."
ATTENTION! Justin Timberlake just wants to make money. He doesn't care what they make him say or how his ass flaps. 
This is dope.
"THUMBS UP FOR EVEYONE WHO'S WATCHIN THE NEW MUSIC VIDEO FROM BRANDON LAMAR CALLED ""I JUST WANT IT ALL"", THAT JUSTIN TWEETED <3333333

"I didn't even realize he was ""gone"". Oh, my mistake, I was listening to music."
"I used to think Justin was only another sellout artist performing and singing whatever was written for him with a side of charisma and showmanship. Over the past 10 years he has definitely earned my respect not only as a singer and performer, but an actor as well. Whatever is in store, without a doubt, it will be great.  "

"This has my so fucking psyched :) I was only just thinking a couple of weeks ago about whether or not he'd be back :) Time to bring an amazing singer back in to the mix to show all the crappy people like One Direction, Justin Bieber etc how it's done :) Good to have you back JT.

"No he's better than Usher, Usher has been making watered down techno-dance music ever since it became the big fad of the decade. All his stuff with David Guetta and his lack-luster R&B songs. JT had the decency to step away from music for the last 4-5 years. Something I respect better than what usher has done in that time. "
"I fucking freaking out, I have loved Justin since I was 4, I uses to dance around my front room to rock your body and I have loved him ever since. I'm glad he's back with the music and I can't wait for the album :)"

I could be a famous musician too, but I never had the in's that JT had. If my parents would have done even one thing I asked to make my dreams come true than who knows maybe I would be one of the FT. artists on one of his songs on this album. But my parents never did shit for my dreams, because we were poor."

I am so pumped.. seriously.
"He cares more about music than anyone else in the world? How could he possibly judge the passions of everyone, let alone anyone?

We need Justin Timberlake back now!!!!!!!!!!
"I entered on this video because I read wrong ""Justin Bieber"", in stead of ""Justin Timberlake"", lol . . . I was prepared to say ""ready for what? that Justin Bieber to get a big boy?"" :))) to be honest, I think many people are jealous on Justin Bieber's youthness, he will look like 20 when he will have 40-60"
"I hope he does the kind of music he used to again, his music was always different from everyone else but that that's why it was so good!"
Arriba Justin Timberlake gran cantante.

"Ignore him. He needs to value you more. The more you ignore him, the more he will try to charm you. That's ok, don't fall for it. Instead look deep into his heart. If there is purity and intention, then, you can make him earn every smile. Otherwise, you can focus your heart on a real prince who may be seeking you out. And you can be friends with this guy. Be in awareness, especially if he is the bad boy with lots of skill, but not enough heart 😊. All the best."
The man is back!
"I don't know how to treat a guy that played me. I knew from the very start he was 1 so I didn't let myself fall for him. He just randomly stops talkin to me.

How should I treat him?"

"If you miss the time when JT ruled. Congrats. He just said in the video that he is coming back. Uhm as much as I remember Britney released her album just a few months ago...so what's the problem? Your loved ones are here - in the music business.
But if you paid more attention to what I replied to you earlier  -I never mentioned anything about Biebers achievments. As I see him -  average voice, bad acting skills, trying too hard, but charismatic, cute ''heartrob'' and THAT plays huge part."

"Can't wait for midnight, i think Justin wanted to feel what he use to feel in music, i guess he lost it and didn't want to make the wrong time of music that doesn't really mean much to him, basically he didn't want to be like all the old artist who know lost their touch"

greatest pop artist with only two albums out? i would say he's one of the best pop artist he has alot of work to do to gain the title greatest im sure he would  will agree with me 
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good talent
"After a seven year hiatus, Justin Timberlake plans to release  a new album this year produced entirely by Timbaland. We expect to get his first track which features Jay-Z very soon!"
Super geeked! Can't wait!
Can we go back to associating the name 'Justin' to Timberlake and not Bieber now?? K thanks.
I like his music and say this with great risk. WHAT A CLOWN.  This video is completely ridiculous and embarrassingly hilarious.  I'm sure recording and writing SEXYBACK and his other songs brought tremendous torture and pain.   
I thought it was a song
"Ahhhhh so ready, like NOW!"
i pissed in my pants when i discovered it yesterday !! holy shit !!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! I THINK I JUST DIEDDDDDDDD ! HE'S BACK ! AND IM READY TOO !!!!

"Even though I am sick of pop music today, I can't wait to hear his new song and album to come out. I like Justin Timberlake. The man has soul in him. He can sing and act. There is nothing wrong with taking a break from music sometimes. The man has been busy making movies and has made tons of money during his break from music. There is more money in acting than music to."
JT is back? The world is about to listen some good music again. We are ready JT
Ready for you! This is it!
Fucking YES!!
2 Days & close 2 million views.... JT we are ready...!!!

Hi s coming back
So Adam Lambert is waiting for Justin's new album...
Why so many negative comments? I don't get it.. 
This is a bit of a disappointment  coming from a fellow K-Pop fan.  What would Big Bang say? 
Excuses
Save yourself from Justin Bieber by not being a troll and talking about him when he has nothing to do with the video.  Do you not get enough attention at home?  
SAVE US FROM JUSTIN BIEBER!!!
"the next decade.....I spent the last decade waiting on an *NSYNC reunion. so naturally I Expect a new *NSYNC album, this decade. "

"Ready for what? Your music is beyond boring. Not sure who even cares, but I'm sure your management company and record label will flood TV, radio and internet with pub, and we are going to hear your boring ass music everywhere I go. You were a member of N'synch right? You used your boy band status to stay hot, oh and the relationship with Spears made you a media darling. That's why your famous as you are. Justin Timberlake is a mediocre singing talent who can dance. But he's white. So he's famous"
fuck off
That gave me a boner and I haven't heard the music yet
"It's kind of funny how the y'all talk about Justin Timberlake like he is "" legit"" compared to Justin bieber ... he was part of nsync you know! .... And he wanted to sign bieber .... however his music is a million times better but let's not make him out to be beethoven... "

It'll be awesome if eminem and justin timberlake make a song together
"Why yes, I am."

"i'm black, a male, not gay, and love JT. He's good singer/actor/comedian. He's kinda like Jamie Foxx in my book. I'm glad he doesn't make album every year because STUDIO ask him to. Take time your time and put something that you love out there. People who know true talent and true music are willing to wait for the right song..."
He is back i hope
"Not that this matters, but he's wearing SHURE SRH940 Headphones, same as me ^_^"
Oh. My. God.
He is actually a good artist and a good weed smoker :)
The resurrection of the real Justin. 
I can't wait!!!!!
Let's gooo!!
This has made my year.
The OG Justin is back.
"JT's a phenomenal actor, writer, comedian, singer/musician. 

I'm glad he only releases the music that he loves, no matter how much time it takes. 

Looking forward to this next album. "
Justin Timberlake is really talented. His songs are original and genius. I hope he doesn't disappoint

Justin im so happy. Ive listened to ur music since nsync. I was about 4 when i started listening. Im 15 now and i still blast nsync and ur solo records. Keep making music. None of the artist today compare to u. U will always be my fav singer. I cant wait to here what great new music u release.
Its gonna be a great come back this year for JT!
"Okay, now, Justin. Get on a track with Chris Brown. I would be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire. Can't wait till you drop some new shit."
"Shit just got real lol

So you're obviously a shit head belieber.
It should be: I'm broke.

YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
ooo shiit justin timerlake music was the bomb back in the days... wish a good comeback this year!!!
"yay hes coming back, i love his music "
"ew, Christina can stay home"
yes it is
"You're very right, sir. I also was disturbed by the very big quantity of Justin Bieber songs. I am not trying to be a hater, but he just doesn't have the voice. Here, take my thumbs up."
Been waiting for this!!! Yaaaaay:)
"Yes!, I'd kill for a Justin/Christina 2013 tour! :-)"
HE´S BACK! 
Can't wait to hear his first single! I believe he wanted to take a little break from singing and work more on his acting career. But now he's coming back after about 5 years! Looking forward to his new album and I hope he returns to SNL!
Let the church say Amen!!
Yes!!! JT Mother lovers
woah this gave me the chills!
ooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Someone explain to me why this means the end of Justin Bieber? Aren't their demographics completely different?
best belated christmas present x
That is just plain stupid ! And he really needs to shave those eyebrows.
"Move along Justin Bieber, JT is bringing sexy back!!"
I hope if he makes a new album that he works with Timbaland on it cause I think they work well together. It worked for Futuresex/Lovesounds which was a great album which Timbaland produced a lot of songs on it.
Haha yeah i see what your saying lol. No doubt there was people bumping Thriller out their car stereos back in the 80's but not now lol.  Check my seriously old cover of a JT song on my channel if ya got spare time mate
Wow...I'm gonna wear my shirts wrinkled now.
YEAAH Justin timberlake & Michael Jackson <3

and... Michael Jackson? haha
Mj and Jt are my two favorite male singers ever
"I LOVE U!!
cant wait to see your work!"
i hated the guy back in NSYNC but he's done well for himself since. Britney has to be getting all wet thinking about how normal his life has been compared to her's
amen
really Brit :D? lmao 
ooooh maaaan! I am so excited!! can't wait!!!
about fucking time! cant wait!
"We look forward to your next recordings, Justin. Take care."

"I'm gonna pay someone to follow me around all 2800 square foot of my house for a solid minute while I do my own voice-over about how passionate I am about my job, and then plop down nude on my bed and say to my wife, ""I'm ready."""

ı would understand ıf u talk about sinatra but u say eminem is better than jt u r being ridiculous whatever go back and listen we made you  u r right eminem-manson the greatest singers ever
It's all about Justin Timberlake not about Justin Bieber 
I'M READY TOO !!!!!!!
Woohoo
"More like ""real garbage"""
468 Dislike... haha nice try Bieber
Western shit music is back behind our Asian pop !!!! Boooooo
"Its about time Justin, you've been sorely missed"
"I don't actually ""like"" Justin Bieber, I just don't hate him for no reason like everybody else seems to do..."
I wish more artists did this. They sit back and let everyone else put out some bulls#*t crappy album. J.T. is like a good stock company that is doing all the behind the scene work not worrying about anyone else. I think he will kill it.
Omg!!! Yes
Ready yo retire?
"HE'S BRINGING SEXY BACK!!
"
Sooooooo this is the parody of Brad Pitt's Chanel?
Thought's on what this album might sound like?
False no one does.
Hahahaha ''real music'' hahaha
Back to the roots!!
Ugh his voice
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!
So ready
He should start working with The Neptunes again
"WHAT ARE YOU READY FOR, TELL ME"
Omg I have loved him since I was SIX! Can't wait for the song (:
Nice Justin nice get'em  boy
Epic.
"yo justin bieber is a cool dude, let bygons be bygons man but shout out to JT. We want a Drake collaberation!"
Hello.....he's multi talented and just doesn't do one thing.
"Agreed Justin Timberlake!  You gotta do it how you feel it so that you stay true to yourself!  Hats off to you!  You are a very talented artist and great things come to those who wait and let it happen naturally!  Get the most out of your life!  Love ya!!!
"
"are you talking about futuresex/lovesounds? Im from germany too. and his album was/is amazing, it is genius. i also went to a concert, and it was the best day in my live. he also held my hand for a second or two :-)"
jus cause u dont got any and no not what it means you can just shut it up
"Wait, I don't get it. Don't really follow pop music, but I'm wondering how'd he stay so big and didn't vanish with only 2 albums in 10 years?  Did he just release singles throughout? "
Directed directly towards Rihana new albums every November.
"HURRY UP!!!

Please save pop music Justin
FINALLY!!!!!  I just can't wait!!!!! 
Beib's definitely hasn't heard anything yet. That's too funny.
Aye of course. Numbers of copy sold to girls aged 6-18 = good music. Silly me. 
Vry good
COMEBACK
Cant wait!!! I know this will change the music once again! 
Hahahaha clearly you don't know how good music is done.
Justin needs to tell his teeny bopper female fans to fuck off if he wants to be taken seriously.
He's not even good why he act like that
"i love you, always have, always will. youre an amazing singer and actor, ad i hope to be hearing about u more soon xD"
You can tell he's in the zone there toward the end. Finally.
"Ahhh yes, Nstink, a band in the 90's for people who haven't heard of eminem.

Seriously all boy bands and teen obsessions need to leave, release a song with some emotional value. This comment will probably be flagged as spam and disliked but listen to an eminem song and see if you still think that the lyrics aren't 1000 times better than this I dare you."
"OMG, he is ready :P"
"What is this high school drama acting? This conceited vague bullshit, constantly spewed with no real meaning or plot. There's no substance, he's not really saying anything. All hype for what should be a normal announcement for artists. ""I'm going to record"" WOW NO SHIT, that's why you're called an artist and not a lazy scumbag who feeds off of advertisers and naive children."
"Time to sit back and watch how it's done kids. The ""Real"" Justin is back!"
I had a chance to bring sexy back while he was gone and I BLEW IT!!!! (no homo)
"Like ciara said "" i been gone for to long now its time to bring it back ""
now lets see you bring your SEXY BACK >>> LOL Welcome Back Justin Timberlake =)
"
"Woo hoo Justin is Back, Sexy Motha F#@cka! "

yooo I was jus telling my sister the other day where the hell Justin Timberlake went. He's such a good artist. He puts a lot of work into his singing and dancing and works with the best producers. I'm so glad he's back. Pop is a good genre with the right artists. JT is one of those artists.
wait for it. it's gonna be legen...
I'M READY TOOO!!!!

"MJ basically created POPular music, it's his legacy, he could be dead but his music isn't, JT is probably the best pop artist since MJ but nobody will ever take MJ''s Spot as king as pop!"
In MJ's case its different. He'll forever stay the king of pop.
Idiot MJ will forever stay the King of Pop. No other artist will take that crown form him.

"@missym877 how is Beyoncé's voice irritating?! Her voice is the best in the industry, in terms of what she can do with it, especially when so many people like Britney, who have been around for years, just use autotune. But I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion :P"
damn justin bieber grew up
Hell the fuck no. Why stick a talented person with someone with no talent?

I've watched this so many times. It seriously motivates me so much. I've always loved him but this gives me so much more respect for him. I like that he refuses to put something out just to put it out. He wants to perfect his craft which is why he's so good at what he does.
Been waiting for to long! LET GOO !! :D

No one can understand how ecstatic i am for JT's music!!!
beiber fans are intimidated by this video cause they know the real Justin is back
He's gonna put Bieber to shame! 2013 will be JT and Beyonce's year! These two make all the other pop stars look like amateurs. Better take notes Bieber and Rihanna. 
Justin T. is irrelevant. Bieber brought sexyback!
God answered our prayers!!! I cannot wait!! My inner teen is very excited!! lol
YES! YES! YES! WE CANT WAIT!
Justin's last album is still too advanced and is much better than much of the music coming out nowadays.

I like all the people praising this Disneyland douchebag on this board. How much did JT pay you fools? Tell you what: Smash your ipods and leave the music to people who can actually hear for once.
"Fan bases are different. Teens will still care for 1D because it is in their generation in as much the same way fans of Timberlake continue to adhere to his music, because they most likely grew up with him, their generation’s pop star. I doubt Timberlake markets adolescent teenagers exclusively. Timberlake returning to music does not guarantee the demise of 1D. 
Timberlake FTW, though. "
"Jeezus God help us, more sonic torture coming as if we don't have enough already. Don't tell me: He is going to spend months recording, weeks filming the music video for a song that was written in about 2 seconds and will undoubtedly sound like some late career Michael Jackson twitching Tourettes POS. Quick, please, someone pay him off not to go back to music. Isn't there enough aggravation today?"
jay park? what do u mean?
JT was my fucking childhood. <3 and I'm sure a lot of ladies (and gentlemen) will agree.
"about damn time....
jk, cant wait JT, a huge fan of your music, always gets me in the mood for dancing. "

"Remember Justin Timberlake was once more corny than Bieber, but he turned himself into an artist, who's to say Bieber can't do the same?"
Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds are classic albums. I can't wait to see what Justin comes with. I just hope it's just as original and creative as those two. Not like what we're seeing today.
WELCOME! YOU ARE THE ONE AND ONLY JUSTIN!

omfg he's so fucking COOL OGGMSOFJIOANFOCJN OMG
I really hope JT brings it becuase the expectation is high..i Hope not too high..welp..all the best young man.
ive been waiting six long years for a follow up album. Ive been a fan since i was a kid and still listen to his music today. He is truly the new King of Pop.
"You're wrong...
"
"what does this got to do with bieber? Can't you look forward to Timberlake's music and enjoy it without pulling down someone else? Why don't u say usher, or chris brown or neyo or trey songz or all the other male artist out there? but no, bieber is on your mind..its ridiculous.so JT's competition is bieber?didn't realise you thought he was good.otherwise why would u even mention him.just chill and enjoy who u like.I welcome back JT but I also love JB and so does his milions of fans.so BACK OFF!"
...where's the hype? I think everyone's forgotten about him
Chajndudhsdjss dhbssishisebsiebid sodsbusebissbshbswi!!!!!!!!! In3&:&3383£:!:8!/9;!/& ...... Yes in excited :D
Ahhh I can't wait for this !
"Just b/c 1D became successful in 2 years doesn't mean anything. Sure they may have talent, but there are a ton of artists they can't even compete with. Odds are 1D will lose their popularity and split in the next few years, that's how it usually goes with boy bands. It's the hard truth. And I'm sorry but 1D brings NOTHING to music these days. They make the same generic crap music as everyone else. JT is the real deal. Once he's back in music, no one will care about 1D anymore. I guarantee it."
SZTOS
Oh ma jznajbd jsdjsjdmsh! We'll be there! I guess our mob's ransom finally got to him. :)
"His shirts mad wrinkled... 
"
"I actually cried over this. Oh, ny gosh. The real Justin of pop music is back! Oh, how I've missed you! Is real music making a comeback? I'd say so."
"Thank you for this brief on you, Justin. Best of luck with everything. It is always good to hear from you."
Hallelujiah we finally have sexy back :D
"I'M CRYING SO MUCH RIGHT NOW I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
"
SOOOO EXCITED! 
Album entirely produced by Timbo! :D
I've always been ready. Let's bring some JT back! 
So do we get a name to call fans of Justin Timberlake? I say Lakers?
awwww sheeeeet. Please say The Neptunes and Timbo are doin this shit Justified style
"THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE 
JUSTIN WE'RE READY

"We're ready for you too JT! I've been waiting for your return to Music - we can't wait =D

This is nice and all but when's the Nsync reunion???
"Oh gosh i'm so exciting, Justin, we miss U SO MUCH !! And the world of music miss U too !"

"u r so weird
"
This is coming from the same guy who did an [unaired] SNL skit saying he should have been nominated for 'at least a Golden Globe' for his role in The Social Network. Is it any surprise? 
He's bringing sexy back
Bring the SEXY back baby!!!!!
Oh thank god!!! I'm so excited!!! Finally ..... Many years in the making I sent this video to all my friends who I know will be super  stoked as well!!! Can't wait to hear it!!!
What do they have to do with Timberlake? They're a bunch of teenagers. He's a grown 32 year old man.
bieber RIP
"OMG he is coming back finally!!!!!!
"
"OMG FINALLY! JT IS BEING SEXYBACK AGAIN! 
I CANT STAND LISTENING TO JUSTIN BIEBER AND ONE DIRECTION ANY LONGER! "
My insides are doing sommersaults. I trust his work will be great :p
Hell iyéah the Fucking king is back :D :D
"I bet he expects an Oscar for this mini doc that he produced, wrote and directed. I love his music, but his self congratulatory vibe he has been putting out since appearing in movies is gross. It totally comes through in this,  ""something I..I..I don't love"", really? Scripted emotions?"
yay! thanks for liking my comment everyone. maybe wild party will thank me LOL
Pince of Pop 
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG THE PRINCE HIS BACK
ABOUT TIME EORHJOIRGJOERIJGEORJIG
justin bieber take a fking seat and watch the show
FUCK YEAAAAAAH
jdkflas;ghiowghl;augwiejofkgl;adhrowiegjf;ahgioa;boa;ijgdklvad;goijafwblj
Don't be so lazy Justin! You have a gift that billions of people crave for and you are capable of more than two albums in a decade. 
"wohowowowoow Im ready tooooooo, cant wait :)"
"Ciara has songs out now ""I'm sorry"" and ""Got me good""... but she needs help :(  Missy put out ""9th Inning"" also, but that too was mildly accepted.  Everybody just needs to come back super hard."
I don't know why I can't post the video. But please everybody check out the video Top 11 reasons why I love Justin Timberlake. It's a little something I did. Thanks. 
It's about freaking time!!!! 
OH MY GODNESS.
Fuck yes.
^clown
"Wooooooooooooow I waited for it

XD crazy"
SO EXCITED!!
Espero este album de este gran cantante no imagino con lo que vendra vi todas sus peliculas y me parecio nice ahora su album
A bit dramatic ;-)
Mind BLOWN
"Pleeeease Justin, collab with Xtina :3 "
means more to you than anybody?  putting your shitty pop above people?  that's classy.
Awesome teaser. 
"WE'LL BE WAITING :D ahhh,"
I'm ready.
"wow, what a bunch of pretentious bullshit. dude loves himself."
Que bien Justin...
ahhh WE ARE READY JT!!!
I'd expect this kind of announcement if scientists found a way to bring John Lennon and George Harrison back to life and they were starting to work on a new Beatles album. Justin is acting like our world has been in black and white ever since he stopped making music and now our world is in color again after announcing that he's giving us new songs. Even Jesus didn't make this kind of announcement three days before Easter.
He couldn't taken a lesson from David Bowie. this is a bit much
Can't believe it's already been 6/7 years since Future Sex/Lovesounds
damn he needs to deliver now.. or he will be DONE!
"nicky minaj, justin bieber, lady gaga, rihanna , katy perry and others, after years of torture finally something good is comming! cant wait!!!!!"
Yeah what happened to Missy? I miss her too. 
"JT is such a freakin badass! bout time tho! 
I'm gonna be listening to this along with ""Wild Party - When I Get Older"" on repeat. if you guys haven't heard wild party yet, check them out.. gonna be huge someday, i'm callin it. "
Can.not.wait!!!!
if anybody produced a beat for justin he would still kill it
I adore justin timberlake
C'mon Man Kill The Bieber And 1D Generation And Bring Us Your Amazing Hits!:D
I'm ready since I remember! so glad you too! :)
Future Sex/Lovesounds was a classic! Hope he's cooking up something epic!
He needs timbaland and the neptunes
lets see
yaas cant wait
"He just saved my 2013 <3 So happy about it, I missed him!"
NEPTUNES DUDE NEPTUNES
AMEN !!!!!!!
oh please be another album - PLEASE!!!!!!! I have been dying for this for YEARS!!!!!
"ALL THE WAITING, ALL THIS PHYSICAL TORTURE, I CANT HANDLE IT. TOO MUCH PERFECTION."
"ohh,.. his back,. and can't wait,...
"
"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES, NEW MUSIC FROM JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE!!! 5 YEARS WAITING!!!"
I'M READY
Finally something good to choreograph to! 
"Nice one Andy. And Justin Bieber is ""Never again"" gonna be on top ""Until the end of time"". ""I'm Lovin' It"" "
"there's nothing narcissistic about it. it's how it is making music, or any art of that sorts."
"Digging my grave, not ready for the amazing flawless Justin Timberlake. I feel like I'm 16 all over again."
Dope shit!
Should have just released a piece of the song. This monologue crap is cheesy and comes off as narcissistic. 
Plz do another collab with Andy Samberg
HOLLY SHIT!!!!!!! CANT WAIT
So... I called out of work today just for this ?
Oh Shit!!! its about to go Down.
Fantastic news! I'm so so happy!
"Omg that is so true. I saw Justin bieber's video as long as you love me, where he does that short video in the beginning and his acting his horrible. You can tell that's all scripted. Lol. 
"

"About damn time.
"
Pharrell FTW!
Soooooo freakin happy :))!!!!!

Justin you better bring it! And shut everybody down and show them how it's done. 
YOU BETTER HAVE SOME BEATS PRODUCED BY PHARRELL 
FINALLY FINALLY JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS BACK!!!
@bronxny1219 they're going to cry me a river
"woohoo!!! this makes me almost as happy as that new wild party band. If you haven't heard ""Wild Party - When I Get Older"" yet you need to. You'll hear it sooner or later tho i bet bc they're gonna be really big I bet. wild party and JT are on repeat for me!!!!!!"
"I just fucking cried, it came from nowhere..I'm so unbelievably HAPPY. Fingers crossed his working with Pharrell again..."

And us JT fans are all gonna be happy that he's ""Gone"" lol. Man I'm good. Using two songs in one comment. Everybody like this so it can be the top comment. "

"dont compare quality music to profitable one, sometimes good music makes money, most of the time it does not"
Why would you compare JB and JT. Two completely different generations. JB fans probably don't remember/weren't even alive when NSYNC debuted.
Well well well its about damn time
"so work hard the real justin come 
back"
"yeeeeeeah!!!! I LOVE U! 
"
YeSsssssss. Finally.
"there's only prince of pop
and that's Justin Timberlake
motherfuckers"

OH MY GAWWWWDD!!! M CRYING!!! YEEESS JUSTIN!
IN WHAT LIFE DUMBASS
yeah. bieber got no grammy. JT got 6grammys only by 2 albums. that's the fact ^^ 
Can we just try not to compare Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake and just enjoy his come-back ?!!!
but he was fighting with usher over getting justin to sing with him thats how talented justin bieber is even JT knows it btw justin bieber has sold much more record than JT and has more awards and broke so many world records and justin bieber is only 18 so yeah know you facts bye ... 
"This better not be a movie trailer -_-. U BETTA NAHT Timberlake...U BETTA NAHT! With that said, omg I love you. >.<"
"Justin, please back to music!!!!"
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He's back to black talking timberlake now?
Finally!

ouiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii can't wait
@SheebyRose FOR REALLLLL!!!

"Finally after six years, king is back!
"
I CAAAAAAN'TTTT WAAAAIIITTTT!!!!
and they're back
Than this wannabe? More like bieber is the wannabe. Bieber is constantly being compared to Justin Timberlake. It's not the other way around. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
just yes.
which studio is he at?
I'm dead!!
And they never saw Justin Bieber again...
"bieber sold 6 millions of his two first albums and JT 16 millions, try again"
"Game changer. JT's back to show that little Bieber how it's done! 

BOOM. x"
"come back justin. save us of bieber.

So are we. Bring it back JT

"He's not a wanname, and the number of records sold doesn't make JBieber a better artist. FYI"
yay! thats awesome that he' s making music again!
I've been patiently waiting ! So glad you're ready ! x0
"WOW , i just realized that i love this guy!!!! Missed you JT"
"2013 has just begun, but I think I love it already. Thanks, Justin. Can't wait to see you on stage."
American Music Awards Facebook page brought me here :)
Je suis tellement heureuse qu'il prévoit enfin un nouvel album <3
"STFU we don't care if you like bieber more the jt, how the fact that you think bieber is better should prevent him from doing music? we got no time for childish people like u bye"

"Thats how it should be... An artist should take their time making an album and.not just make one every couple months, I'm glad Justin took his time and now he's returning #JT2013"
SAMBA

How many doors is he gonna go through dammit?
I can't wait to his new song ! <3 loove him !<3

I CAN'T BELIEVE!!!!! J.T. is coming back to our ears *-*
OMG. THE HYPE IS REAL!!
JT is a genious. Very smart choice to not overload people with album after album year after year. If you are just trying to please a record label more than likely you will not truly enjoy your music the same as if you were to take your time on it. Really looking forward to what he has ins tore!
I'm waiting for this day for YEARS!!!!
